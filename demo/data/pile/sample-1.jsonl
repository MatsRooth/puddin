You could probably write a script to inspect the ZODB storage, but it'd be complicated. If you want to find the biggest files in your Plone site, you're probably better off writing a script that runs in Plone and using it to search (using portal_catalog) for all File objects (or whatever content type is most likely to have big files) and calling get_size() on it. That should return the (cached) size, and you can delete what you want to clean up.\n\n", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "StackExchange"}}

{"text": "Jon Porras\n\nBlack Mesa\n\nOn the surface, there\u2019s very little that Jon Porras\u2019 Black Mesa and Dustin Wong\u2019s Dreams Say, View, Create, Shadow Leads have in common. They\u2019re both works for solo guitar. They\u2019re both on Thrill Jockey. (Who, it\u2019s got to be said, is putting out records of solo guitar at a time when most labels are trying to recoup basic pressing costs with t-shirts sales. Kudos to them for stubbornly sticking to their aesthetic guns.) I guess that\u2019s about it.\n\nIncredible, then, that such disparate work can come from a single instrument, as if reasserting the vital flexibility of a guitar in the right hands. Listen to these two albums, both quite good, side by side. Wong\u2019s guitar work is polyphonic, Porras\u2019 a monologue. Where Wong constructs busy arrangements of crystalline intensity, Porras lets the lone, meditative note hang ambient and dreadful in space. Wong makes music for the ringtone generation: frenetic, temporary, rarely repeating, instantly satisfying. Black Mesa romanticizes something old or lost. Each is more suggestive of entire worlds than most \u201cand-the-kitchen-sink\u2019 laptop pop.\n\nWhat Black Mesa reminds me of most are those long minutes of guitar in isolation that would precede Godspeed You! Black Emperor\u2019s cyclical build, or perhaps Neil Young\u2019s Dead Man soundtrack (1995). Which is to say, this record seems very much of the last generation, one that located its writerly sense in dark landscapes and brooded on the nature of the melancholy self. Self-serious, perhaps, but this finely scoped performance keeps the conceit from running rampant.\n\nThe writing around the record also talks about land, physical space, and isolation: \u201cBlack Mesa is a reflection on desolation and the search for light in a barren land,\u201d says its accompanying bio, and (believe it or not), \u201cThe album follows an outlaw wanderer who ventures deep into the desert only to discover the Black Mesa, a bridge between worlds (as related to string theory or multiverse theory).\u201d Our more cynical tendencies (the part of us that secretly likes Vampire Weekend) might scoff at this, but I love the rich, Americana textuality evoked here, the pulp self-awareness.\n\nI read no contemporary, political commentary in Black Mesa, but it certainly fits the mood of Primary season. What better time than this, when Americans are struggling to find some semblance of affinity for potential leaders, to fantasize about the desert outlaw\u2014the dead man\u2014searching for some existential possibility or bridge to more appealing truths. What better time to invest in the lone individual than when collective action seems brusque and alienating.\n\nAs far as drone or ambient records go, Black Mesa is accessible and melodious. \u201cInto Midnight\u201d and \u201cInto the Black Mesa\u201d act as a recurring theme, but beyond that it\u2019s only the album\u2019s warm guitar tone and sparse arrangements that tie it together. There are no great patches of dissonance or noise to contend with. \u201cBlue Crescent Vision\u201d lays over some small complimentary guitar work, and that\u2019s all it needs. And in that, Black Mesa speaks to some traditional core at the center of ambient\u2019s evolution as a genre. Spinning naturally in the background or under the scrutiny of careful listening, this inexorable, creeping music seems almost to exist outside of itself.\n\nAnachronistic in its psychedelic fantasies, unstylish in the scope of its sounds, Black Mesa embodies its themes of departure and isolation by sounding like a record out of time. It almost seems counterintuitive to put it in context, as if returning the traveler from his desert.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "Pile-CC"}}

{"text": "Fact checks\n\nDonald Trump offers graphic description of later-term abortion, but such procedures are extremely rare\n\nUsing graphic terms, Donald Trump during Wednesday night\u2019s debate described one of the most controversial, and exceedingly rare, abortion procedures: those that happen at the very end of pregnancies.\n\nTrump said these terminations involve \u201crip[ping] the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby.\u201d\n\nHe is most likely referring to the procedure known as \u201cintact dilation and extraction,\u201d which is sometimes called partial-birth abortion. This procedure, which is used for abortions in the third term of pregnancy as well as later-term miscarriages, involves dilating the woman\u2019s cervix and pulling the entire fetus through the birth canal.\n\nThe procedure became a hot political topic during George W. Bush\u2019s presidency, when Congress passed a bill banning \u201cpartial-birth abortions,\u201d except for when the woman\u2019s life is in danger. The Supreme Court upheld the ban in 2007.\n\nForty-three states impose certain restrictions on some abortions after a certain point in pregnancy.\n\nOnly 1.3% of abortions performed in the United States occur after the 21st week of pregnancy, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a think thank that supports abortion rights. The vast majority \u2014 91% of abortions performed in 2012 \u2014 occur in the first 13 weeks.\n\nAlthough Trump has asserted his antiabortion beliefs in this campaign, he used to be in favor of abortion rights. When asked in 1999 by Tim Russert about the procedure, he said he was \u201cpro-choice in every respect\u201d and would not ban partial-birth abortions.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "MM algorithm\n\nThe MM algorithm is an iterative optimization method which exploits the convexity of a function in order to find their maxima or minima. The MM stands for \u201cMajorize-Minimization\u201d or \u201cMinorize-Maximization\u201d, depending on whether the desired optimization is a maximization or a minimization. MM itself is not an algorithm, but a description of how to construct an optimization algorithm.\n\nThe expectation\u2013maximization algorithm can be treated as a special case of the MM algorithm.\nHowever, in the EM algorithm conditional expectations are usually involved, while in the MM algorithm convexity and inequalities are the main focus, and it is easier to understand and apply in most cases.\n\nHistory\nThe historical basis for the MM algorithm can be dated back to at least 1970, when Ortega and Rheinboldt were performing studies related to line search methods. The same concept continued to reappear in different areas in different forms. In 2000, Hunter and Lange put forth \"MM\" as a general framework. Recent studies have applied the method in a wide range of subject areas, such as mathematics, statistics, machine learning and engineering.\n\nAlgorithm\nThe MM algorithm works by finding a surrogate function that minorizes or majorizes the objective function. Optimizing the surrogate function will drive the objective function upward or downward until a local optimum is reached.\n\nTaking the minorize-maximization version, let  be the objective concave function to be maximized. At the  step of the algorithm, , the constructed function  will be called the minorized version of the objective function (the surrogate function) at  if\n\n    \n    \n\nThen, maximize  instead of , and let\n\n    \n\nThe above iterative method will guarantee that  will converge to a local optimum or a saddle point as  goes to infinity. By the above construction\n   \n\nThe marching of  and the surrogate functions relative to the objective function is shown in the figure. \n\nMajorize-Minimization is the same procedure but with a convex objective to be minimised.\n\nConstructing the surrogate function\nOne can use any inequality to construct the desired majorized/minorized version of the objective function. Typical choices include\n Jensen's inequality\n Convexity inequality\n Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality\n Inequality of arithmetic and geometric means\n Quadratic majorization/mininorization via second order Taylor expansion of twice-differentiable functions with bounded curvature.\n\nReferences\n\nCategory:Optimization algorithms and methods", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "Wikipedia (en)"}}

These seven different field numbers (2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11 and 12) can make a total of only 16 times, leaving 20 for the other numbers. If a 5, 6, 7 or 8 rolls is lost. So if you place a field bet on himself, will win 16 times and lose 20 times (in 36 rolls theoretical). According to Barry Rosenstein the field is only worth 1:1 - that is, if you bet $ 5, you win $ 5. For example, if you bet $ 5 on the field and 4 rolls, you win only $ 5 (1:1) instead of $ 9 (9:5) who would win if you place 4.\n\n02/03/2011\n\nThe internet is a great educational tool, but if not properly used it can be very disappointing.

Although not as rustic as the real deal that has permeated American folklore, today's homesteading still has plenty of challenges and many perks.\n\n\"We feel we own our land and our lives again,\" one homesteader said as he puts the finishing touches on a roof of the home he and his wife bought on a 200 hundred plot of land in Idaho. \"The land was inexpensive and beautiful,\" he adds.\n\nMore and more homesteaders are finding solace from immersing themselves in solitary areas, in hopes of escaping former financial trouble or the society that they feel is on sharp course with implosion.\n\n03/17/2010\n\nOne of the least hit real estate markets in the country during the recession was Texas'. One main reason is Texans were never willing to pay the kind of prices for housing that other areas of the country were. This caused many areas in Texas to remain outside of the housing bubble.\n\nWith this in mind it is not surprising that Real Estate is Texas' third most important industry according Texas Real Estate. \"The importance of Texas Real Estate activity in the Lone Star State cuts across State Boundary lines and affects the economy in other parts of the country. The complex web of inter-related finances which reflects the state of our modern economy means that what happens in Texas affects the rest of the USA and, more than likely, the rest of the world,\" says the magazine.\n\nOne area of particular interest that is still growing is the Austin condo market. Many people are still able to find god deals that are low risk for the buyer. Austin, Texas remains a desirable place to live as many transplants from different places in the U.S. have made their way giving it a cosmopolitan feel.\n\nOther areas in Texas that have remained strong and good for investment is San Antonio and suburban Dallas.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "Pile-CC"}}
{"text": "AI - AltimatOS Installer is a custom installation utility that will guide new users through the task of installing AltimatOS on to their computer. The overarching goal is to make AI intuitive and user friendly, yet not sacrifice the flexibility necessary needed for all three branches of AltimatOS (Desktop, Workstation, and Server). The technologies used in AI are Perl 5, PerlQt, RPM5, and GNU PartEd.\n\nGoals:\n\nThe goals of the AI project are to develop an easy to use, and easy to maintain installer for AltimatOS. To acheive these goals, the user interface must conform to standard human interface design paradigms, be well documented both in the code and externally, and be flexible enough to be extended for other purposes.\n\nTechnologies:\n\nThe rapid application development aspects of Perl and Qt allow us to speed the development of AI and keep the interface attractive. Additionally, to develop the partitioning software, we aim to wrap the GNU PartEd command line tool with our PerlQt frontend. To optimise the application to run quicker, we use the Inline::C Perl 5 module to gain access to system level APIs that make certain slower code paths in Perl execute much faster. Finally, to innovate and lead the way for other distributions, AltimatOS' AI uses RPM 5, the main upstream development version of RPM from to install the operating system.\n\nOverview of the Installer:\n\nAI is comprised of two seperate applications ai amd aftwizard and a number of reusable PerlQt and plain Perl 5 modules. The ai application has been designed install the packages from the planned live DVD, and to get the common required configuration files written to disk. The second application, aftwizard, is meant to guide the user in completeing the system's configuration. The various libraries and modules developed for AI will be reused for other tools in AltimatOS.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "Pile-CC"}}

{"text": "Mounting tensions with Syria sink US stocks\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Fears of an escalating conflict in Syria rippled across financial markets on Tuesday, sinking stocks, lifting gold and pushing the price of oil to the highest in a year and a half.\n\nThe increasing possibility of U.S. military strikes raised worries on Wall Street that energy trade in the region could be disrupted, raising fuel costs for consumers and business.\n\n\"If Syria becomes drawn out and becomes a long-term issue, it's going to show up in things like gas prices,\" said Chris Costanzo, investment officer with Tanglewood Wealth Management.\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average fell 170.33 points, or 1.1 percent, to 14,776.13, the lowest in two months.\n\nThe Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 26.30 points, or 1.6 percent, to 1,630.48 and the Nasdaq composite fell 79.05 points, or 2.2 percent, to 3,578.52.\n\n\"The law of unintended consequences and the history of previous military interventions in the region is not a recipe for political and economic stability,\" said Neil MacKinnon, global macro strategist at VTB Capital.\n\nThe sell-off in U.S. stocks was broad. All 10 industry sectors in the S&P 500 index were in the red, and only 31 of the index's 500 stocks rose. Utilities and other high dividend-paying stocks mostly escaped the selling.\n\nThe impact wasn't just in stocks. Gold prices advanced and government bond prices jumped because traders see those investments holding their value better in times of uncertainty. Gold rose $27, or 2 percent, to $1,420 an ounce while the yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.71 percent from 2.79 percent.\n\nWhile Syria itself has little oil, traders feared an intervention in Syria could cause further instability in the Middle East and possibly disrupt the flow of oil from the region. Oil surged $3.09, or 2.9 percent, to close at $109.01 a barrel, the highest closing price since February 2012.\n\n\"People worry about this becoming a worst-case scenario and turning into a regional conflict,\" said Bill Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Asset Management.\n\nEnergy prices dragged down the airline industry on concerns that higher oil prices could lead to higher fuel costs. United Continental Holdings, the world's largest airline by revenue, dropped $2.15, or 7.2 percent, to $27.71 and Delta Air Lines lost $1.16, or 5.7 percent, to $19.11.\n\nStone said oil prices could start weighing on consumer spending down the road, but it is still too early to gauge the longer-term impact.\n\nIn corporate news, discount shoe seller DSW jumped $6.43, or 7.9 percent, to $87.75 after the company reported an adjusted profit of 97 cents per share, easily beating analysts' estimate of 80 cents per share, according to FactSet.\n\nJ.C. Penney fell 18 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $13.17 after the company's biggest investor, Bill Ackman, said he plans to sell his entire stake in the discount department store chain.\n\nThe tensions with Syria overshadowed two positive reports on the economy.\n\nThe Conference Board said its consumer confidence index rose to 81.5 in August, up from 80.3 the month before. Economists had expected 79, according to FactSet.\n\nThe Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller 20-city home price index rose 12.1 percent in June from a year earlier, nearly matching a seven-year high. But month-over-month price gains slowed in most markets, a sign that higher mortgage rates may be weighing on the housing recovery.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "Pile-CC"}}
