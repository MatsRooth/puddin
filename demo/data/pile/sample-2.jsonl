All 10 industry sectors in the S&P 500 index were in the red, and only 31 of the index's 500 stocks rose. Utilities and other high dividend-paying stocks mostly escaped the selling.\n\nThe impact wasn't just in stocks. Gold prices advanced and government bond prices jumped because traders see those investments holding their value better in times of uncertainty. Gold rose $27, or 2 percent, to $1,420 an ounce while the yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.71 percent from 2.79 percent.\n\nWhile Syria itself has little oil, traders feared an intervention in Syria could cause further instability in the Middle East and possibly disrupt the flow of oil from the region. Oil surged $3.09, or 2.9 percent, to close at $109.01 a barrel, the highest closing price since February 2012.\n\n\"People worry about this becoming a worst-case scenario and turning into a regional conflict,\" said Bill Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Asset Management.\n\nEnergy prices dragged down the airline industry on concerns that higher oil prices could lead to higher fuel costs.

Penney fell 18 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $13.17 after the company's biggest investor, Bill Ackman, said he plans to sell his entire stake in the discount department store chain.\n\nThe tensions with Syria overshadowed two positive reports on the economy.\n\nThe Conference Board said its consumer confidence index rose to 81.5 in August, up from 80.3 the month before. Economists had expected 79, according to FactSet.\n\nThe Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller 20-city home price index rose 12.1 percent in June from a year earlier, nearly matching a seven-year high.

The most intense structures typically occur near each other, in the form of vortex tubes surrounded by straining sheets, as shown in Fig.\u00a0\\[fig:Qstruc\\]. This organization\u2014a sort of vortex-strain *worm-rolls*\u2014is characteristic of turbulent flows\u00a0[@Zeff2003; @Ray2009; @Schumacher2010; @Gotzfried2017], and its origin and dynamical implications continue to be investigated [@Guala2007; @Hamlington2008; @Ray2015; @Wilczek2015; @Lawson2015; @Ray2018]. These structures distinguish fully developed turbulence from purely random flow fields, and must play an important role in many aspects of turbulent transport. The most important of these\u2014because it remains central to our understanding of phenomena as diverse as the formation of planets in circumstellar disks [@Lissauer2013] or the initiation of rain in warm clouds [@Grabowski2013; @Chen2018]\u2014is the growth of macroscopic aggregates, due to collisions and coalescences, from nuclei-particles (dust or aerosols) suspended in a turbulent flow. The role of the underlying turbulent carrier flow is critical: Estimates of, e.g., the rate of growth of these aggregates in the absence of such flows do not agree with that seen in nature\u00a0[@Pumir2016]. Indeed, the explanation of such rapid growth through coalescence, demonstrated [@sundaram1997; @Bec2016; @Onishi2015] and quantified in terms of flow statistics [@vobkuhle2014; @Pumir2016; @Ireland2016], is rooted in the ability of turbulent flows to enhance the rate of collisions between nuclei seed-particles.\n\nA critical discovery, due to Bec, *et al.*\u00a0[@Bec2016], was to find the precise connection between the intermittent (multiscaling) nature of the carrier turbulent flow and the accelerated growth of aggregates. And yet the implied correlation between the structure of the flow and droplet collisions-coalescences remains unknown. Indeed, there is evidence to suggest that flow structures matter. But the question is how and when?\n\nIn this paper we answer this question comprehensively, based on detailed state-of-the-art direct numerical simulations (DNSs), and show how straining regions are intrinsically more effective at generating collisions than vortical ones even for uniformly distributed *inertia-less* particles. Particle inertia widens this discrepancy, not simply by preferential concentration, but also by selectively increasing the collision velocities in straining zones. This is because straining regions have a larger proportion of *head-on* or *rear-end* collisions, as opposed to *side-on* collisions, which are predominant in vortical regions. Consequently, a larger fraction of the velocity gradient in straining zones is translated into the particle approach velocity. Finally, and most strikingly, we show how intense vorticity and strain, cohabiting as vortex-strain *worm-rolls*, conspire to generate rapid, violent collisions.\n\n![A representative snapshot of three-dimensional contours of ${\\mathcal Q}$ showing intense vortex tubes (opaque red: $+5.6 \\sqrt{\\langle {\\mathcal Q^2}\\rangle}$) enveloped by dissipative, straining sheets (transparent blue: $-2 \\sqrt{\\langle {\\mathcal Q^2}\\rangle}$).[]{data-label=\"fig:Qstruc\"}](Qstruc2.pdf){width=\".8\\columnwidth\"}\n\nWe therefore consider a turbulent flow whose velocity $\\bm u$ (subject to the incompressibility constraint $\\nabla\\cdot {\\bm u} = 0$) is a solution to the Navier-Stokes equation $$\\partial_t {\\bm u} + ({\\bm u} \\cdot \\nabla){\\bm u} = -\\nabla p + \\nu \\nabla^2 {\\bm u} + {\\bm f}$$ where $\\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity. We perform DNSs on a tri-periodic domain with $N{^3}=512^3$ grid points, by using a standard de-aliased pseudo-spectral solver\u00a0[@Canuto1_2006] and a second-order Adams-Bashford scheme for time integration. A statistically stationary, homogeneous and isotropic flow is maintained by the time-dependent large-scale forcing $\\bm f$, which injects a constant amount of energy into the first two wavenumber shells. This forcing scheme enables us to control the time-averaged energy dissipation $\\epsilon$, which is chosen such that the the Kolmogorov length $\\eta = (\\nu^3/\\epsilon)^{1/4}$ satisfies $\\eta k_{\\rm\nmax} \\approx 1.7$ (where $k_{\\rm max} = \\sqrt{2}N/3$ is the maximum resolved wavenumber). The Taylor-Reynolds number (${\\mbox{\\textit{Re}}}_\\lambda = 2E\\sqrt{5/(3 \\nu\n\\epsilon)}$, where $E$ is the total kinetic energy) of the flow is 196.\n\nTo identify vortical and straining structures in the flow, we use the ${\\mathcal Q}$ criterion\u00a0[@Dubief2000; @Blackburn1996; @Chong1990] through the velocity gradient tensor ${\\mathcal{A}}  = \\tau_{\\eta}\n\\nabla {\\bm u}$ (normalized by the Kolmogorov time $\\tau_\\eta=(\\nu/\\epsilon)^{1/2}$) which yields the symmetric strain rate tensor ${\\mathcal S} = ({\\mathcal{A}}\n+{\\mathcal{A}}^{\\mathrm T})/2$ and the anti-symmetric rotation rate tensor ${\\mathcal R} = ({\\mathcal{A}} -{\\mathcal{A}}^{\\mathrm T})/2$. To compare the relative magnitudes of strain and rotation, we define $S^2 = {\\mathcal S}_{ij}\n{\\mathcal S}_{ij}$ and $R^2 = {\\mathcal R}_{ij} {\\mathcal R}_{ij}$, the difference of which is related to the second invariant of the velocity gradient tensor: ${\\mathcal Q} = (R^2 - S^2)/2$. Regions where ${\\mathcal Q} < 0$ are dominated by irrotational strain, while regions where ${\\mathcal Q} > 0$ are vortical. Near-zero values of ${\\mathcal Q}$ may correspond to zones with weak velocity gradients, or to strong shear layers where ${R^2 \\approx S^2}$ [@Ireland2016]. Figure \\[fig:Qstruc\\] presents contours of large positive and negative values of ${\\mathcal Q}$, which reveal characteristic vortex-strain worm-rolls.\n\nWe introduce in the flow $10^6$ identical particles, each having a sub-Kolmogorov radius $a = \\eta/3 $ (we have checked that the results reported here are consistent for smaller radii as well, up to $\\eta/10$) and a density $\\rho_p$ much larger than that of the carrier-fluid $\\rho_f$. The particles occupy a small volume fraction of ${\\mathcal O} (10^{-4})$ and their influence on the flow is negligible. Since the Reynolds number associated with their slip velocities is small, the evolution of particle trajectories $\\bm{X}_{p}(t)$ is determined by the simplified Maxey-Riley equations\u00a0[@CroorRev2017]: $$\\frac{d \\bm{X}_{p}}{dt}=\\bm{V}_{p}, \\quad\\quad \\frac{d \\bm{V}_{p}}{dt}=-\\frac{1}{\\tau_{p}} [\\bm{V}_{p}-{\\bm u}(\\bm{X}_{p},t) ] \\label{eq:maxey}$$ where $\\tau_p = 2 a^2 \\rho_{p} /(9 \\nu \\rho_{f})$, the particle relaxation time, yields the Stokes number (${\\mbox{\\textit{St}}}=\\tau_p /\n\\tau_\\eta)$, which provides a non-dimensional measure of the particle\u2019s inertia. We consider several families of particles, with ${\\mbox{\\textit{St}}}$ ranging from 0 to 16.75. For non-zero ${\\mbox{\\textit{St}}}$, Eqs.\u00a0 are solved by using an exponential integration scheme [@Ireland2013]. The case of tracers ${\\mbox{\\textit{St}}}=\n0$ is handled separately, by directly setting ${\\bm v}_{\\rm p}(t) = {\\bm\nu}({\\bm X}_{\\rm p}(t),t)$ and by using a second order Runge-Kutta time-stepper. The fluid velocity at the particle position is obtained via fourth-order B-spline interpolation [@Hinsberg2012].\n\nAfter the randomly-seeded particles have settled into a statistically stationary distribution, we begin detecting collisions using an algorithm similar to that in Ref.\u00a0[@sundaram1997]. We use the standard *ghost collisions* approximation\u2014 ignoring coalescence and other post-collision outcomes\u2014to focus on the role of flow structures in bringing particles together and enhancing collision rates.\n\n![Bi-probability distribution functions $P(R^2,S^2)$ for inertia-less (tracer) particles, corresponding to the values of $R^2$ and $S^2$ sampled by (a) particles and (b) collision locations, which show the disproportionate bias towards collisions in strain-dominated regions. []{data-label=\"fig:RS\"}](RS_St0.pdf){width=\"1.0\\columnwidth\"}\n\n![image](AngM_St0.pdf){width=\".8\\textwidth\"}\n\nThe rate of collisions depends, of course, on the relative velocity of particles at contact\u00a0[@Bhatnagar2018; @Saw2014; @James17]. For tracers (${\\mbox{\\textit{St}}}= 0$) or nearly-tracer particles (${\\mbox{\\textit{St}}}\\gtrsim 0$), this is determined by fluid velocity gradients ($\\propto \\tau_\\eta^{-1}$), which increase in magnitude as the flow becomes more turbulent. This picture, underlying the seminal work of Saffman and Turner\u00a0[@saffman1956], is blind to flow structures: It disregards whether the local velocity gradient arises from rotation or strain.\n\nInertial particles (${\\mbox{\\textit{St}}}> 0$), e.g., droplets in air, do not respond instantaneously to changes in the flow. Such particles *preferentially concentrate*, thereby increasing their local number density\u00a0[@sundaram1997]. They can also attain relative velocities much larger than that of the underlying flow. Dubbed the *sling effect* [@Falkovich2002], these events correspond to the formation of singularities or *caustics* in the particle velocity field [@Wilkinson2006; @Croor2015]. Although clustering and caustics have been tied to the centrifugal ejection of heavy particles out of vortices, they also occur in smooth random flows that are devoid of structure [@Bec2005; @Wilkinson2007; @sticky; @Gustavsson2013; @Gustavsson2014]. Consequently, the presence of these effects does not necessarily imply that collisions sense the structures of turbulence.\n\nTo unambiguously determine the influence of the local flow field, we must begin with tracers which remain uniformly distributed in space. To allow for collisions, the radii of these particles are kept (artificially) finite, while their inertia is ignored. According to the Saffman-Turner theory\u00a0[@saffman1956], collisions should occur uniformly between any two regions that possess the same velocity gradient magnitude, regardless of whether these regions are vortical or straining. We now examine this hypothesis, bearing in mind that a discrepancy will implicate flow structures that are intrinsically more effective at causing collisions.\n\nTowards this end, we calculate the values of $R^2$ and $S^2$ along particle trajectories, as well as at collision locations. The results for inertia-less particles are presented as joint probability distributions functions $P(R^2,S^2)$ in Fig.\u00a0\\[fig:RS\\]a and Fig.\u00a0\\[fig:RS\\]b, respectively. It is immediately clear that collisions under-sample vortical regions ($R^2 > S^2$) and over-sample straining regions ($S^2 > R^2$), relative to where particles reside. This is also seen in Fig.\u00a0\\[fig:Ang\\]a, which overlays contours of $P(R^2,S^2) = 0.1$ and 0.02, for particles (dashed) and collisions (solid). The strain (vorticity) dominated portion of this plot is shaded in blue (red), and corresponds to ${\\mathcal Q}\n< -0.3$ (${\\mathcal Q} > +0.3$).\n\nThis surprising result is an outcome of the distinct flow topologies of these regions which cause particles to approach each other differently. Fig.\u00a0\\[fig:Ang\\]b presents the distribution of the cosine of the collision angle ($\\theta$), for straining (blue) and vortical (red) regions. $\\theta$ is defined as the angle between the relative velocity vector ($V_{p1} - V_{p2}$) and the separation vector ($X_{p1} - X_{p2}$) at collision. Particles in straining regions tend to collide in a head-on or rear-end manner ($\\theta\n\\approx 0$ or $\\pi$). In either case, a large fraction of the velocity difference between particles contributes to their rate of approach or collision velocity ($\\Delta v_{||}$). On the other hand, particles in vortices undergo collisions that are closer to being side-on, in which case the separation vector is nearly perpendicular to the relative velocity. This results in lower approach velocities in vortical regions, as shown in Fig.\u00a0\\[fig:Ang\\]c. Consequently, over a given time interval, fewer particles will collide in vortical regions compared to straining regions with the same magnitude of the velocity gradient and particle number density.\n\n![image](Q_d_vr_St.pdf){width=\".95\\textwidth\"}\n\nHow does particle inertia affect this picture? Figure\u00a0\\[fig:den\\_vr\\]a presents the average value of $\\mathcal Q$ sampled by particles (dashed-red) and their collision locations (solid-black) as a function of ${\\mbox{\\textit{St}}}$. At ${\\mbox{\\textit{St}}}= 0$, $\\langle\n{\\mathcal Q} \\rangle$ is 0 for particles and -0.04 for collisions. Remarkably, this offset is strongly amplified by inertia and reaches a maximum around ${\\mbox{\\textit{St}}}\\approx 0.3$, beyond which particles begin to de-correlate from the underlying flow and eventually collide uniformly. The preference of *inertial* particles (${\\mbox{\\textit{St}}}> 0$) to collide in straining regions has been reported previously by Perrin and Jonker [@Perrin2014; @Perrin2016]. Our results demonstrate that this effect is not fundamentally tied to particle inertia, but rather is an amplification of a difference that exists even for inertia-less tracers, raising the question: how does particle inertia selectively enhance collisions in straining regions?\n\nOne possible explanation is provided by preferential concentration: Heavy particles are centrifuged out of rotational regions, and thus tend to accumulate in straining zones just outside vortices\u00a0[@Croor2015]. This causes the number density to increase in straining regions, at the expense of vortical zones, as shown in Fig.\u00a0\\[fig:den\\_vr\\]b. Here, $n$ is a coarse-grained number density, obtained by dividing the domain into bins of size $20 \\eta$. The average $\\mathcal Q$ in each bin is used to distinguish between vortical ($\\mathcal Q > 0$) and straining regions ($\\mathcal Q < 0$) and obtain the conditionally averaged number density. All else being equal, higher number densities imply larger collision rates [@Pumir2016]. However, we see that the maximum difference in number densities occurs near ${\\mbox{\\textit{St}}}\\approx 1$, which is *not* where the maximum difference in $\\langle\n{\\mathcal Q} \\rangle$ is seen (Fig.\u00a0\\[fig:den\\_vr\\]a). Hence another mechanism must be involved.\n\nInertia is also known to increase the relative velocity between neighboring particles [@Saw2014; @James17], which should result in higher collision velocities. On examining this effect in straining and vortical regions separately, we find that it is stronger in straining regions and, in fact, has no impact on vortical regions for small ${\\mbox{\\textit{St}}}$. This is demonstrated in Fig.\u00a0\\[fig:den\\_vr\\]c, which presents the average values of $\\Delta v_{||}$, conditioned on $ {\\mathcal Q}$. It appears that head-on (or rear-end) collisions, which prevail in straining zones, are more amenable to being sped-up by inertia than side-on collisions. Notably, the maximum difference between collision velocities occurs near ${\\mbox{\\textit{St}}}\\approx 0.3$, which matches well with the maximum difference in $\\langle {\\mathcal Q} \\rangle$ (Fig.\u00a0\\[fig:den\\_vr\\]a). Thus, larger approach rates, rather than number densities, appear to be the primary reason for the effectiveness of straining regions in creating collisions.\n\n![image](lag_avg.pdf){width=\".91\\textwidth\"}\n\nThus far, we have considered vortical and straining regions individually. Particle inertia, however, permits structures within a distance of $\\tau_p V_p$ to influence a collision. This raises the possibility of vortical and straining regions conspiring to enhance collisions, especially for moderately large ${\\mbox{\\textit{St}}}$. For example, the geometry of vortex-strain *worm-rolls* (Fig.\u00a0\\[fig:Qstruc\\]) will cause particles in intense vortex tubes to be rapidly ejected into strong straining sheets, where they are very likely to collide.\n\nWe search for evidence of this effect by tracing, backward in time, all particles that collide in straining regions. For the subset that do have atleast one particle originating from a vortex, we record (i) the time taken to collide after leaving the vortex and entering the straining zone ($t_{strain}$), as indicated by $\\mathcal Q$ changing sign; (ii) the strength of the vortex, measured in terms of the maximum positive value of $\\mathcal Q$ sampled inside the vortex ($\\mathcal Q_{vortex}$); (iii) the intensity of straining at the collision location ($\\mathcal Q_{col}$); and (iv) the collision velocity. While measuring the vortex strength, we only back-track for a time of $3 \\tau_{\\eta}$ within the vortex, to ensure that the $\\mathcal Q$ values obtained are relevant to the subsequent collision. The conclusions are insensitive to the exact value of this threshold.\n\nFig.\u00a0\\[fig:lag\\] presents the results of this Lagrangian calculation, conditionally averaged on $t_{strain}$, for ${\\mbox{\\textit{St}}}= 1, 0.6$ and $0.1$. The data for moderately large ${\\mbox{\\textit{St}}}$ (1 and 0.6), reveal the impact of vortex-strain worm-rolls. Particles that collide quickly (small $t_{strain}$), are found to originate from more intense vortices (Fig.\u00a0\\[fig:lag\\]a) and to collide in stronger straining regions (Fig.\u00a0\\[fig:lag\\]b). This signature weakens considerably for less inertial ($St = 0.1$) particles which are mildly ejected and relax faster to the local straining flow.\n\nThe collision velocities for small $t_{strain}$ are also systematically larger (Fig.\u00a0\\[fig:lag\\]c). The standard deviation about each data point (not shown for clarity) is of the order of the average value. Thus, several small $t_{strain}$ collisions have very large collision velocities, indicative of caustics/sling events, which are known to dominate the collision rate for $St >\n0.5$ [@vobkuhle2014; @Pumir2016]. Traditionally, these have been linked to rapid ejection from vortices [@Falkovich2002]. Our results indicate that this is only half the story: Straining sheets which envelope strong vortices also contribute to generating violent collisions and enhancing collision rates.\n\nAn appreciation for flow structures naturally leads one to ask how collisions are affected when structures change. The influence of $Re_\\lambda$ is particularly important to consider, as the estimated values for natural flows are orders of magnitude larger than what can be attained in simulations [@Grabowski2013; @Lissauer2013]. Increasing $Re_\\lambda$ results in higher intermittency, which translates into more intense structures (see, e.g., Ref.\u00a0[@burgersvortex] for a similar study of a model stretched-vortex), but which occupy smaller volumes. These competing effects are known to produce a non-monotonic variation of particle clustering [@Onishi2014]. Regarding collisions, our initial calculations show that differences between vortical and straining regions increase from $Re_\\lambda=69$ to $196$; it remains to be seen in a systematic way how this phenomenon is affected in a higher Reynolds number flow.\n\nFlow structures can also be significantly modified by new physical interactions, for example, condensation of water vapour on cloud droplets, which releases latent heat and energizes small scales [@Croor2017], and elastic feedback from polymers that suppresses small-scale motions [@Liberzon2006; @Prasad2010]. Studying collisions in these complex flows is an interesting avenue for future work.\n\nBefore we conclude, it is essential to place our work in the context of turbulent transport problems\u2014a canonical example being that of rain-initiation in warm clouds\u2014which have application across the areas of non-equilibrium statistical physics, geophysics, oceanography, astrophysics and atmospheric sciences. Understanding these problems demands not only an appreciation of how fast droplets sediment, collide and coalesce (in which tremendous advances have been made in recent years) but also knowledge of *where* such processes are most likely to occur. This paper, therefore, contributes to a fuller understanding of this question.\n\nWe thank J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Bec, S.

{"text": "Some of you are too young to relate to this, but North American Gen-Xers like myself remember childhood summers where we would leave home after breakfast to play and not come home for eight or nine hours. As long as we were home in time for dinner, our parents didn't raise an eyebrow. It was considered normal. If you're a ten-year old, try that today and see what happens. Amber Alerts will rain down from the heavens in an organized fury! This isn't a criticism of the Amber Alert system. The idea of your child going missing is a nightmare of unparalleled scope to a parent, and having a system in place to find them as soon as possible is a good thing. But the fear to be found in a society that needs such a system is unbelievably destructive, and many factors dovetail to create this fear. Many of you won't believe this, but Western societies are safer than they ever have been in history. This is hard to believe because of a constant struggle between two human factors, the Head (rational thought) and the Gut (hard-wired survival instincts). This conflict is laid bare in a new book by Dan Gardner: RISK:The Science and Politics of Fear. Within this 300+ page book, Mr. Gardner, a journalist and historian, throws the fear that pervades our lives into sharp relief. He not only shows how we're all wired to be terrified of unrealistically small risks, he also shows that the media, our governments, and big corporations encourage these fears. Sometimes they encourage them for mercenary reasons; other times, the fear is encouraged inadvertently. There is a constant battle being fought in our psyches between these two 800-lb. gorillas within our behaviourial matrix. Generally, we rely on Gut to guide us in making decisions, with Head stepping in to ameliorate the more extreme reactions with rational assessments. For example, if we hear an ominous sound in a dark alley, Gut sets off the alarm and tells us to leave. Head, however, also notes that there's quite a wind blowing, and the sound we heard could be easily explained by boxes and cans being knocked over. We adjust our reaction and carry on. Sometimes though, Head isn't given enough (or any!) information to be helpful in adjusting Gut's reactions. Gardner explains that much of this comes from the advent of mass communications, which is no real surprise. A century ago, your window to the world was in fact the front window of your house. You paid attention to threats that were local. You could read the paper and note the threats that were far away, but they had little impact on your daily assessments. Fifty years ago, your window to the world was the television. With visuals and the humanizing effect of in-person interviews, distant threats became more real and pertinent to Gut. Today, what you see on television has become your local community, with all of the rapes, murders and abductions from around the world neatly organized and queued up for your consumption. When a sweet little girl 1400 km away goes missing, Gut tells you that all little children in your immediate community are at risk. The truth, of course, is quite different. But the truth, the hard numbers that make sense to Head, are decidedly unavailable. When you watch the news, you're told truthfully that cancer rates are set to rise sharply over the next 15 to 25 years. What the newscasters (and cancer foundations) don't give you is the context, that due to dramatic improvements in health care, people are living much longer and cancer is by and large a disease of the elderly. An aging population will by definition become one where incidents of cancer will rise. Without that latter piece of information, Gut is left to shriek in fear in the corner, and money flows into the coffers of Big Pharma, sunscreen manufacturers and cancer research foundations. Funding going to research to fight cancer is certainly an excellent thing, but this example serves to show you that even noble, altruistic organizations have no problem with manipulating the public to help serve their ends. Where were you on 9/11? Everyone remembers. I also remember that the U.S. airline industry took it in the pouch for a full year after that tragic day. Almost no one wanted to fly, because Gut said that the risk was too great, and Head had no data to mitigate that fear. Everyone decided to drive instead, and this choice caused a spike in driving deaths. In the U.S., there is a 1-in-135,000 chance of being killed in a hijacking if you fly once a month for a year -- trivial odds, especially when you consider that there is an annual 1-in-6,000 chance of being killed in a car crash. Nearly 3,000 people lost their lives on 9/11. The switch from flying-to-driving caused an additional 1,595 people to die the year following 9/11. The news media didn't notice, because it wasn't spectacular like 9/11 or Hurricane Katrina. Only the loved ones of the dead paid any attention. The \"spectacular\" litmus test for today's news channels is what helps drive so much of this unreasoning fear. Gut believes that what we see on the news, the spectacular tragedies of serial killings, child abductions, terrorism, ad infinitum ad nauseum is a truthful representation of our world. So Gut rightfully judges our world to be a terrifying place, where paedophiles, terrorists, murderers and cyclones lurk around every corner, to pounce on us the instant that we stop being careful. We vilify the news media for being merchants of fear, yet what the news media offers is what we want. Gut is always looking for examples of threats to help protect us, and eats up what CNN and its brethren have to offer. The more we watch, the more scared we become, and the more scared we become, the more we want to watch. In many ways, we created what the media have become today. I picked up Gardner's book and consumed it in two sittings, then went back to read it again. His writing style is clear and his research is impeccable. The only agenda he has in this book is to educate the reader on how we are doing a fantastic job of undermining our own world by scaring ourselves and allowing ourselves to be scared. In an age where fear is the coin of the realm, learning of what we should be reasonably scared about (and it's none of the things you hear about on the news on a daily basis) is priceless. I highly recommend Gardner's book: 5/5. By the way, in Canada, the number of children under the age of fourteen that were abducted during the years 2000 and 2001 by someone other than a parent was exactly one. That's an annual risk rate of 1 in 5.8 million. And yet you can bet junior isn't allowed to go out to the park to play hide-and-seek alone with his friends. Imagine what he's going to teach his kids.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "Tag Archives: west texas\n\nPost navigation\n\nIn the summer of 1980, if I remember right, we traveled from Kansas to northern Arkansas to visit my Dad\u2019s older brother, Uncle Don. He, my Aunt Mary and my cousins lived in Harrison, near Dogpatch. I also remember something about getting some Cavender seasoning, since it\u2019s made in Harrison. (I still use it today, although I prefer the salt-free form).\n\nAs we traveled to Harrison, my seven-year-old mind seemed to record us being on some sort of mountainous hill. One road went to Harrison while another road seemed to lead to another town down in a distant valley. A look at a map reveals it might\u2019ve been Omaha, Arkansas.\n\nTo this day, 32 years later, I still wonder about that town. What was its name? What secrets did it hold? What stories did it tell? Or, did it exist solely in my imagination?\n\nI have resurrected and transported the town approximately 800 miles southwest into West Texas in a short story I am working on, titled Garth, Texas. In this lengthy, in-progress short story, a road goes up a hill, reaching a zenith; what lies on the road beyond the zenith is completely unknown to anyone seeing the road from the main road it bisects.\n\nBut to those who travel to the top of the road, they will see a sharp, gradual decline as the road slopes downard for about five miles. And in the distance is a tiny speck of a town.\n\nForget defeat, headaches, past-due bills, the death of your favorite pet duck, the election of a woefully-inexperienced president, a traffic jam when you\u2019re already late, finding out the man/woman of your dreams is already married, running out of iced tea and a check-engine light on your car\u2019s dashboard. Nothing is more agonizing than writer\u2019s block.\n\nLet me take stock. I have a novel and several short stories in the production stage. Currently, I\u2019m about two-thirds done on my rough draft of The Game Show and am about a third into my short story whose name I\u2019d rather not divulge. Both are suspenseful thrillers with characters that seem alive and well.\n\nMy problem? I am not sure what to write next.\n\nIn my short story, for instance, a man stumbles upon a town that\u2019s not on the map in West Texas and learns, much to his dismay, the locals already know who he is and want to punish him for past deeds. What happens next is something I can\u2019t quite figure out.\n\nSame for the book about a game show where more meets the eye. And, of course, same for the short story about the astronomer who discovers a strange planet and a long short story about a man who buys a gorgeous house at way below its appraised price.\n\nHow do you overcome writer\u2019s block?\n\nI think I may need to google \u201cLois Duncan\u201d and \u201cwriter\u2019s block\u201d and see what she wrote about it in The Writer magazine. We\u2019ll see if that helps.\n\nRichard Zowie\u2019s first short story was a very forgettable one, written on a single sheet of notebook paper when he was eight. Scorpions in a lake. Blech. Post comments here or e-mail Richard at richardzowie@gmail.com.\n\nPlease keep in mind that this is not a critique of Mr. Bradbury\u2019s book Zen in the Art of Writing. This blog posting is simply what I\u2019ve gathered from the book and how I think I can apply it to my own fiction writing career. It\u2019s also my motivation to finish this book and to move onto others.\n\nI\u2019ve often wondered how to best describe Bradbury as a writer to those unfamiliar with his work (my two favorite Bradbury books are The Illustrated Man and Fahrenheit 451). Perhaps Stephen King said it best: with Mr. Bradbury, everything\u2019s green and wondrous and seen through a lens of nostalgia.\n\n\u201cThe Joy of Writing\u201d chapter\n\nMr. Bradbury believes it\u2019s imperative to write with zest and gusto. Writing should be pleasurable, so have fun with it. This type of mentality helps a person put out 2,000 or so words a day. If you find it a burden, then you may have a problem. The same rings true for other professions. To be a successful chef, Gordon Ramsay has said you must a passion for cooking. Actors have told me that getting in front of a camera or on stage requires a love for performing; if your motivation is fame or fortune, forget it.\n\nWhat should a person write about? Things that you love or hate. One example Mr. Bradbury references is seeing a photo in Harper\u2019s Bazaar that used Puerto Ricans in the background as \u201cprops\u201d. Upset by this, Mr. Bradbury wrote a short story where a Puerto Rican man taunts such a photographer by always appearing in his photographs and making some type of gesture that ruins the picture. In his book On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft, King recounts working at a mill and hearing a crazy story about how giant rats lived in the cellar of a decrepit building. Wheels spun and soon King wrote the creepy short story Graveyard Shift.\n\nSometimes we write about our fears. One short story I\u2019m working on focuses on one of my worst fears: having an automobile breakdown in the summer heat in the middle of nowhere. The main character is on the run from the police but has his car break down in one of the more rural areas of the country: West Texas.\n\nSometimes, Mr. Bradbury feels writing a story can be as simple as finding a character who wants or doesn\u2019t want something with all their heart. Give them orders, let them go and follow them and write what you see happening. Darn the outlines and character profiles, full speed ahead!\n\nWriting also requires a person to read voraciously and diversely. Books, magazines, anything you can get your hands on. Myself, I suspect much can be learned even by reading bad prose. You learn how not to write and what doesn\u2019t work. For me, what comes to mind is one particular sci-fi novel written by a scientist who simply wasn\u2019t a good writer. Another involves a curious delve into trasy western paperbacks where the methaphors are so bad they\u2019re comical. Obviously, this is best kept at a minimum while energies should be focused on good writing and what does work.\n\nFinally in this chapter, Mr. Bradbury reminds us that life is indeed very short. Write. A writer writes now. Procrastination is the death of writing. This is indeed something I can relate to: my twenties flew by and now, at 37, I\u2019m beginning to wonder what happened to my thirties. If only we lived on a planet like Pluto, where the days are six days long instead of a measly 24 hours.\n\nUp next, the chapter \u201cRun Fast, Stand Still\u201d.\n\nRichard Zowie is a professional writer. He\u2019s worked as a journalist and columnist and also blogs and writes fiction. Post comments here or e-mail him at richardzowie@gmail.com.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "Pile-CC"}}

{"text": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Ms Trump is poised to take on a prominent role in her father's White House\n\nShe is a successful businesswoman, author and celebrity in her own right, with a reported net worth of $150m (\u00a3120m). But what new role might the president-elect be contemplating for his daughter, Ivanka?\n\nThirty-five-year-old Ivanka Trump is used to a life in the spotlight.\n\nAs a teenager, she worked as a model. As an adult, she has a wide-ranging empire that touches fashion, business, media and self-help.\n\nBut she faces an entirely new level of scrutiny as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to move to the White House - and to take Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, with him.\n\nTrump announced in November that his wife, Melania, would be staying in New York - at least initially - after his inauguration to allow their youngest son, Barron, to finish the school year.\n\nMeanwhile, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner are considering a move to fashionable Georgetown in Washington DC, amid reports Mr Trump is giving the couple office space in the White House usually earmarked for the first lady.\n\nSusan Swain, an author of a book on the first ladies, says Melania's decision represents a departure from typical White House protocol. But it is not surprising for a family encountering the fishbowl of DC politics for the first time.\n\n\"Every first lady has to make this job in their own image, so they can survive in it,\" said Swain, noting that First Lady Michelle Obama also considered staying in Chicago with the couple's two young daughters after Obama won the election.\n\nMelania Trump's decision to stay in New York represents a sentiment shared by first ladies through the generations, she says - to preserve a sense of normality, and shield the children of the president from public eye as much as possible.\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\nA $50,000 (\u00a340,129) cup of coffee with Ivanka Trump\n\nThe Eric Trump Foundation is auctioning off a cup of coffee with the future first daughter, the New York Times reported.\n\nOzan M Ozkural, a London-based investment manager, told the newspaper he bid nearly $60,000 at the chance of gaining insight on how the president-elect plans to deal with Turkey and other nations\n\nThe bidding, which was valued at $50,000, reached $72,888 as of early Friday\n\nEric Trump told the Times he was considering shutting down the event, which was meant to benefit St Jude Children's Research Hospital of Tennessee. The fundraising page has since disappeared.\n\nWhile Melania stays in New York, Ivanka Trump seems poised to take on some of the first lady's duties, serving as de facto hostess for meetings with dignitaries and at formal events.\n\nThis is not particularly unusual, either - US presidents including Thomas Jefferson, Lyndon B Johnson, Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan all had help from family members who weren't their wives in fulfilling the role.\n\nBut Ivanka Trump's role could be bigger. She raised eyebrows at a sit-down with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and, more recently, at a summit with tech titans from Facebook, Apple and other Silicon Valley giants.\n\nCould she have a hand in her father's policy-making? She has championed specific causes in the past - childcare, women's rights and climate change - that may at times be at odds with Republican party line.\n\nMichael Kranish, co-author of Trump Revealed: An American Journey of Ambition, Ego, Money and Power, says while Trump's plans for Ivanka will remain hazy until a formal announcement is made, the president-elect has always relied on family to serve as some of his closest business advisers.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Questions about Ms Trump's role emerged when she sat in on a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\n\n\"Ivanka played a major role in the campaign and transition, so it is widely expected she and her husband, Jared Kushner, will play a very important role advising him,\" Kranish said.\n\nIn an interview with the New York Times, policy adviser Anne-Marie Slaughter said she saw Ivanka Trump as a champion for women in the Trump presidency.\n\n\"She is really serious about the 'care agenda' and can be a strong inside force,\" said Slaughter.\n\nHow formal a role can Ivanka Trump have in the Trump administration? As long as she is not a federal employee, she dodges US nepotism laws established during the Kennedy era to keep family members of a president from taking too much power in the US government.\n\nTrump adviser Kellyanne Conway has indicated that the administration may intend to take advantage of this loophole.\n\n\"The anti-nepotism law apparently has an exception if you want to work in the West Wing, because the president is able to appoint his own staff,\" Conway said, adding the caveat that any work in the White House would need a \"complete distinction and separation\" from Trump's business dealings.\n\nShe has not been named by her father as one of the people running his company when he is president.\n\nBut allegations of conflicts of interest are unlikely to disappear.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption People try on Ivanka Trump jewellery at Trump Tower\n\nShe had a taste of this shortly when she wore a bracelet from her own fine jewellery brand in the Trump family's first nationally-televised post-election interview.\n\nA press release touting the $10,000 piece sparked a minor media flap, prompting a formal apology from the company's president.\n\nWas that misstep a learning experience, or a preview for the types of conflict that will bedevil the Trump administration? Experts say that remains to be seen.\n\n\"We are certainly as a country covering new ground in never having had a business family come to the White House in this capacity,\" Swain said.\n\n\"We can only hope that the Trump family is cautious of all the ethical challenges that could lie before them if they're not careful.\"", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

To this end, a tongue of solid rail profile can be fixed between the stock rail and a clamming jaw disposed stationarily on the opposite side. The foot of the tongue and that of the stock rail are disposed on a common foundation at the same level. As a result, the stock rail is supported substantially on the foundation only by the stock rail half facing away from the tongue. Instabilities are compensated for by the stock rail being attached with supports and angle pieces. This entails additional maintenance work.\nA conventional rail joint is described in DE 30 16 492 A1, for example. There is a slight clearance between the clamping jaws and the facing web surface of the tongue, permitting the requisite movability of the tongue in relation to the stock rail.

Thank you for subscribing See our privacy notice Invalid Email\n\nEamon Cregan shared his observations on the direction hurling was taking when he was inducted into the GAA Hall of Fame back in 2013.\n\nCregan, a star in both defence and attack during a long and distinguished playing career with Limerick, wasn\u2019t decrying the modern game but was particularly concerned about one trend.\n\n\u201cThe perception of marking players seems to have gone out the window,\u201d he said. \u201cThat, to me, would be a basic format of any game of hurling - you must be able to defend.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tremendously exciting but the thing I worry about is the amount of points that are scored - 22, 23, 24, 25 points.\n\n\u201cThat, to me, means there is somebody not doing their job.\u201d\n\nCregan is over 70 now but it would be wrong to label him as a dinosaur who longs for overhead striking and clergymen throwing in the ball. Just last year he managed Mary I to their first ever Fitzgibbon Cup.\n\nLast Sunday\u2019s Tipperary-Cork match has been hailed as an epic but, as enjoyable as it was, surely it isn\u2019t so simple as lots of scores adding up to a magnificent contest?\n\nThere was little in the way of meaty challenges. Cork\u2019s 2-27 was their biggest ever score against Tipperary in a Championship match and it was the highest aggregate tally (62 points) of their 87 SHC meetings.\n\n(Image: Mandatory Credit \u00a9INPHO/Cathal Noonan)\n\nThe closest to it was the 1987 Munster final replay (59 points), but that was played over 100 minutes given the need for extra time.\n\nGranted, there were quite a number of outstanding scores and the standard of striking and athleticism has never been higher, albeit the weight of the sliotar has diminished.\n\nBut there\u2019s an old proverb, \u2018when there\u2019s too much, something is missing\u2019, so has the art of defending been compromised?\n\nDefences sit deeper nowadays to avoid conceding goals but that is offset by being punished from distance with points. Few would argue with the observation that Cork centre-back Mark Ellis had a fine game last Sunday, yet his direct opponent Michael Breen hit 0-6 from play.\n\nThe drawn and replayed All-Ireland finals of 2014 are an interesting study in that regard. There were 54 scores in the drawn game, more than any final in history.\n\nThe replay was a very different affair. Within the opening 70 seconds Kilkenny had effected two blocks and a hook on Tipperary players.\n\nBy the end, there were just 35 scores.\n\n\u201cIt had everything,\u201d said Brian Cody afterwards. \u201cMaybe the previous game lacked a certain element of the quality of things that are needed in terms of being complete.\u201d\n\nAccording to hurling writer, statistician and goalkeeping coach Christy O\u2019Connor, in the 251 Championship games played between 1994 and 2004, there were just 64 occasions in which teams hit 20 points (white flags) or more.\n\nIn last year\u2019s Championship alone, it happened 20 times over 28 matches.\n\nArguably Cregan\u2019s single greatest victory as a manager was Offaly\u2019s 1995 Leinster final win over Kilkenny.\n\nPlayed in a deluge, it was a ferocious affair during which the defensive arts of both teams were a joy to behold.\n\nThere were only eight points scored by half-time, but the contest was no less riveting for that.\n\nThe Clare team of that era generally won games by hitting the 20-point mark.\n\nSuch tallies would be largely inadequate to win games today and while that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing, how much is too much?\n\nThe metric for great games should extend beyond how often the umpires reach for their flags.\n\nCarlow matters to Turlough, if not GAA chiefs\n\nCarlow boss Turlough O\u2019Brien was spot on in his comments having seen his side record a rare Championship win against Wexford.\n\n\u201cWe matter as much as Dublin and Kerry and Tyrone and Donegal and we want to be in the All-Ireland Championship and we\u2019re not going to die down against Dublin, I can guarantee you that,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd yet, he couldn\u2019t have been more wrong. For starters, their next opponents received \u20ac1.28m more than them in games development funding centrally in 2016 according to the GAA\u2019s financial statements.\n\nIt was much the same for years before that and it\u2019ll hardly change much in the coming years either.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the venue for their meeting on Saturday week - O\u2019Moore Park in Portlaoise.\n\nSince Dublin travelled to Longford in 2006, 60 of their 61 Championship games have taken place in Croke Park. By contrast, Carlow have had 25 Championship matches from 2006 on, with just eight of them at home.\n\nUnder the terms of the Slattery Report, Carlow\u2019s Netwatch Cullen Park can hold 11,000, which is deemed too small to cater for the crowd, with O\u2019Moore Park\u2019s greater seating capacity allowing for all Dublin\u2019s season ticket holders. The reasoning stinks.\n\nThe Leinster Council is effectively saying that raking in some extra cash and looking after Dublin fans trumps the idea of fairness in how their competitions are run.\n\nAnd if the season ticket scheme dictates where games should be played, then it isn\u2019t fit for purpose.\n\nAFL's recruits make Mark all by themselves\n\nWhen Paul Earley became the first Irish man to play elite level Australian Rules football in 1984, Tadhg Kennelly was just past his third birthday.\n\nSo, it clearly wasn\u2019t the Kerryman\u2019s brainwave that talented young Gaelic footballers could adapt to the game Down Under.\n\nIn total, 51 Irish players have signed professional forms in Australia and Kennelly, in his role as the AFL\u2019s International Talent Manager, was involved in a low percentage of those.\n\nIf he quit that post in the morning, the practice of AFL clubs looking in on emerging Gaelic talent wouldn\u2019t halt.\n\nThe matter has become topical lately largely because Kerry are affected and Kennelly, one of their own, is at the coalface.\n\nMark O\u2019Connor has adjusted to the game seamlessly after joining Geelong while it\u2019s feared his former minor teammate David Clifford will follow him to Australia.\n\nCounties with smaller playing resources such as Laois and Kildare have been discommoded by AFL poaching to a much greater degree in the past, but with much less uproar.\n\nIt would be naive to think outstanding talents like O\u2019Connor and Clifford wouldn\u2019t have crossed the AFL radar only for Kennelly\u2019s input.\n\nHowever, the argument the GAA should be more concerned about losing players to soccer and rugby doesn\u2019t stack up either.\n\nThose players excelled at those particular sports but AFL clubs are taking Irish players due to their prowess in Gaelic football, which is why the anger of people like former Kerry footballer Sean O\u2019Sullivan is understandable.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "Q:\n\nIs there a name for 'markup'?\n\nI've been trying to formulate a question for quite some time, and I haven't been able to come up with a better way to describe it. I hope it's not too confusing.\nThere are a number of ways to use markup languages to convey information like emphasis in text files. Stack exchange uses 'Markdown' for example. In this case, adding * (in Markdown) or <emph> (in HTML) is simply called 'markup' I suppose, but is there a name for this? That is, making something stand out in the text, be it logically like \"emphasis\" or explicitly like \"bold\" or \"underline\", etc. The only thing that comes to mind is to emphasize, but (to me at least) that implies stressing the word, not what you're doing with the text to achieve that result.\nThis has been bugging me for quite a while, I hope someone can help me out here.\n\nA:\n\nHow about simply to format? You are formatting the text with Markdown. Or how about to style? CSS is called like that for a reason, it's all about styling.\n\nA:\n\nDictionary.com defines markup, amongst other things, as\n\ndetailed instructions, usually written on a manuscript to be typeset, \n  concerning style of type, makeup of pages, and the like.\n\nSo I would say that the best word for this is \"markup\".\n\nA:\n\n\"Markup\" is the generic noun for annotations added to a text, whether done with a pencil or with various electronic means, and whether or not they have anything to do with formatting. Even readers' underlines can be called \"markup\". \nThe corresponding verb is \"to mark up\".\n\"Formatting\" refers specifically to arranging parts of a document into pages or screens. When you make your window narrower, the document gets \"reformatted\", but none of the \"markup\" changes at all.\n\"Markup\" originally involved annotating several kinds of things on paper:  spelling or other corrections; things like breaking a paragraph in half or adding a heading; and giving formatting instructions such as to set a portion in italics.\nIn modern publishing those tasks are commonly separated:\n\nAn author or \"encoder\" identifies parts of a document by \"what they are\" (this bit is a footnote, 2nd-level heading, bibliography entry,\nlist item, command name, etc). This is called \"descriptive\" or\n\"declarative\" markup.\nSomeone decides how each kind of thing should be formatted in a print or online edition. Publishers call this their \"house style\" or similar names.\nSome person or program then applies the design to the objects, via \"formatting\" and \"typesetting\".\n\nComputer-based document systems progressed similarly: Many early ones had commands only for formatting effects: \"change font\", \"shift left margin\", \"switch to bold\", \"skip a line\", etc. Of course, similar combinations are used over and over again, so systems soon provided named sets of instructions for the common kinds of things.\nEventually (starting with Brian Reid's \"Scribe\" system), systems began to allow authors to ignore the \"how\" of formatting almost completely, by just picking \"kinds\" (often called \"styles\"). Many authors just do this, while many others do manual formatting, especially for short documents.\n\"Markup\" is ubiquitous, but \"formatting\" isn't always part of the picture at all. Visually impaired readers may use a screen reader, and objects such as \"heading\", \"footnote\" etc. are communicated in entirely different ways. Similarly, a search engine cares little about fonts, but may care a great deal about which parts are the document title, author name, or bibliography.\n\n", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "StackExchange"}}
{"text": "I finally took the plunge and purchased The Wild Unknown Tarot deck. I have been seeing this deck everywhere on Pinterest, Instagram, and various blogs. I\u2019ve even seen photos of people that have gotten tattoos of the deck\u2019s artwork.\n\nThe artwork in this deck is in a few words rustic, minimalist, and profoundly beautiful. The images seem to avoid many of the new-agey clich\u00e9s that can often be found in tarot decks. I find that this more minimalist and flat aesthetic has allowed this deck to appeal to a much wider audience. It feels as if the creator of this deck, Kim Krans, designed it not for the Witchy or tarot community, but for a much wider audience.\n\nAs a side note, recently I\u2019ve been seeing more and more Pagan and Wiccan things being produced specifically designed for a more general audience. Just the other day I saw the book \u201cWiccapedia\u201d available at my local Urban Outfitters. One must wonder if Paganism becoming more mainstream and acceptable, or goddess-forbid, if is it venturing into the dreaded \u201chipster\u201d zone? Regardless, the mainstream fascination and love for this deck is certainly justified.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "Q:\n\nRandom number seed targeting the same version of the .NET framework\n\nDoes every CPU return the same random sequence based on the same seed if my application targets .NET framework 3.5?  I am checking if you get the same result as me. I am also hoping that everyone who I distribute my application to will get the same result. Thanks!\nRandom a = new Random(44448);\nint i1 = a.Next(65, 90);\nMessageBox.Show(i1.ToString());\n\nA:\n\nFor a specific framework version your program should give the same result each time you run it, because of the fixed seed.\nBut it can give different results on different versions of the .NET framework.\nFor example, on .NET 4.0 I get 77. But putting the code into ideone (which uses Mono) gives 67.\nThe reason for this difference is because the precise algorithm used by Random is not part of the specification. The documentation has this information about the algorithm:\n\nThe current implementation of the Random class is based on a modified version of Donald E. Knuth's subtractive random number generator algorithm. For more information, see D. E. Knuth. \"The Art of Computer Programming, volume 2: Seminumerical Algorithms\". Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA, second edition, 1981.\n...\nThe implementation of the random number generator in the Random class is not guaranteed to remain the same across major versions of the .NET Framework. As a result, your application code should not assume that the same seed will result in the same pseudo-random sequence in different versions of the .NET Framework.\n\nEmphasis mine. There are no guarantees that future implementations will use the same algorithm.\n\n", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "StackExchange"}}
{"text": "Outcomes of sinonasal squamous cell carcinoma with and without association of inverted papilloma: A multi-institutional analysis.\nSinonasal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) accounts for <1% of all malignancies but represents 70% of sinonasal cancer. Up to 10% of SCCs are associated with inverted papilloma (IPSCC). Studies that compare patients, treatment, and outcomes of SCC and IPSCC are absent in the literature. A retrospective review of patients with SCC and those with IPSCC at Cleveland Clinic and Indiana University from 1995 to 2015. The records were analyzed for demographics, tumor characteristics, treatment, and outcomes. The study comprised 117 patients with SCC, of whom, 29 had IPSCC. The mean age at diagnosis was similar: 63 and 64 years for patients with SCC and patients with IPSCC, respectively; with female patients representing 36% and 34%, respectively (p > 0.99).Smokers represented 64% of the patients with SCC and 55% of patients with IPSCC (p = 0.3); excessive alcohol intake was noted in 16% of the patients with SCC and 21% of the patients with IPSCC (p = 0.56).The maxillary sinus was most commonly involved, followed by the nasal cavity (51% versus 35% SCC, 45% versus 38% IPSCC). Frontal ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses contained primary tumors only in patients with SCC. Upfront treatment was surgery in 84% of patients with SCC and 97% of patients with IPSCC (p = 0.18); 68 and 55% received radiation, respectively, and 25 and 21% received chemotherapy, respectively.Overall survival averaged 5.5 and 3.4 years for patients with SCC and patients with IPSCC, respectively (p = 0.12); disease-free survival was 4.8 and 2.9 years, respectively (p = 0.18). Nodal metastasis was more likely in patients with SCC (18 versus 0%; p = 0.02). When divided into high- and low-stage disease: more common nodal metastases were demonstrated in high-stage SCC than in low-stage disease (p = 0.03). Overall survival was decreased between high- and low-grade disease but not when subdivided between SCC and IPSCC. Although SCC with and without IP association are considered different diseases, their demographics and outcomes seem similar. Nodal metastasis was noted to be higher in the SCC cohort, which may indicate different tumor biology. Further study is warranted.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "PubMed Abstracts"}}

{"text": "Dectection of spinal cord lesion using skin electrode recordings of spinal evoked potential.\nThe multi-channel recording of somatosensory spinal evoked potential (SSEP) was carried out on 30 patients with various neurological disorders. In some cases, SSEP changes corresponded well with the lesioned level. In general, the lesions of thoraco-cervical level were difficult to detect, because the appearance rate of SSEP peaks are reduced over the thoraco-cervical spine even in normal controls. In cases with spinal type of MS, SSEP revealed marked changes and subclinical sensory demyelinating lesions were detectable. Chronological SSEP recording in patients with acute transverse myelitis revealed functional improvements corresponding with clinical recovery. Surface and non-invasive SSEP recording is useful for detecting lesions in the spinal cord or peripheral nerves.

{"text": "I\u2019ve been to a number of wakes and funerals, and \u2014 so far so good \u2014 have never stolen anything from the deceased. For some odd reason, that urge never came over me. Now, were the recently departed friend or relative to clutch an object that I wanted, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d have the chutzpah to ask the family if I could have it, but I would still consider asking preferable to taking.\n\nOf course, being an atheist (one who\u2019s been asked where I get my morals if not from God), I have no clue whether my reticence to steal from the dead is morally sound or anything. I concede that I could have been doing it all wrong.\n\nFor help, today I turn to the supreme ethicist in the Vatican, the divinely inspired arbiter of virtue who advises 1,200,000,000 Catholics on what is just and proper. And lo:\n\nPope Francis confessed Thursday that he took the rosary cross of his late confessor from his casket and wears it to this day in a fabric pouch under his cassock. \u2026 He told the story of the \u201cgreat confessor\u201d of Buenos Aires who had heard confessions from most of the diocesan priests as well as from Pope John Paul II when he visited Argentina. When the priest died, Francis went to pray by his open casket and was stunned that no one had brought any flowers. \u201cThis man forgave the sins of all the priests of Buenos Aires, but not a single flower?\u201d Francis recalled. So he went out and bought a bouquet of roses, and when he returned to arrange them around the casket, he saw the rosary the priest still held in his hand. \u201cAnd immediately there came to mind the thief we all have inside ourselves and while I arranged the flowers I took the cross and with just a bit of force I removed it,\u201d he said, showing with his hands how he pulled the cross off the rosary. \u201cAnd in that moment I looked at him and I said \u201cGive me half your mercy.'\u201d\n\nWhat, no \u201cplease\u201d or \u201cthank you\u201d?\n\nAnyway, it turns out that, on the Pope\u2019s say-so, there\u2019s considerable wiggle room in Biblical commandment number eight, Thou Shalt Not Steal. And also in number ten, Thou shalt not covet.\n\nI wonder what other inviolable commands by the Almighty may be safely tweaked to allow us to satisfy our whims and impulses, and I look forward to more Vatican guidance on the matter.\n\n(Image via neneo / Shutterstock.com)", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}
{"text": "JIM YOUNG/GETTY\n\nNew data shows a growing group of gun owners emerging in Cook, County Chicago: Black women.\n\nThe number of Black women receiving a permit in Cook County has grown every year since 2014. According to Illinois State Police, 800 Black women received a license in 2014. And currently, in 2017, nearly 1400 Black women have received a concealed carry permit. That number is already more than the last year\u2019s number. That is a record 67 percent growth from 2014 to 2017. More than 4,000 Black women have received a concealed carry license in Cook County.\n\nBut what is encouraging Black women to arm themselves? According to a Chicago Tribune report, many are \u201cspurred by a growing concern for their safety,\u201d in neighborhoods where crime is surging, the outlet writes.\n\nThis is the sharpest growth in Cook County of any demographic receiving concealed carry permits, based on applicants who revealed both their race and gender. The overall number of concealed-carry permits issued in Cook County fell by 18 percent from 2014-2016.\n\nWhile this group is growing, Black women are still a very small sector of people applying for permits. White women, White men and Black men still make up the majority of people applying for concealed carry permits. These figures also do not include the women who have obtained and do not have a permit.\n\nThe state of Illinois was the last state to allow concealed carry of firearms by citizens. The state\u2019s handgun carry ban law was ruled unconstitutional in 2012. In January 2014, the state police officially began accepting applications to carry concealed handguns.\n\nPermits are $150 for residents or $300 for non-resident, and are valid for five years.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

Peterson appeals from a judgment, awarding her $3,388.50 in damages for breach of contract, and awarding Cornerstone Property Development LLC (Cornerstone) $3,594.93 in costs, in a suit involving Peterson's purchase of an unfinished condominium unit from Cornerstone. On appeal, Peterson raises two issues: (1) the trial court's grant of partial summary judgment to Cornerstone, following the court's grant of Cornerstone's motion to reconsider, dismissing her claim based on a violation of WIS. STAT. \u00a7 100.18(1) (2003-04);[2] and (2) the trial court's grant of Cornerstone's motion in limine to exclude evidence of consequential damages with respect to her breach of contract claim.\n\u00b6 2 Peterson asserts that the trial court erred in granting Cornerstone's motion to reconsider, arguing that her WIS. STAT. \u00a7 100.18(1) claim is not barred by the economic loss doctrine or the contract's integration clause. Peterson also contends that the trial court erred in granting Cornerstone's motion in limine to exclude evidence of consequential damages, arguing that although she agreed to purchase her condominium \"as is,\" more specific provisions of the contract conflict with the \"as is\" provision and must be given effect, making consequential damages recoverable for breach of a more specific provision.\n\u00b6 3 We conclude that the integration clause bars Peterson from pursuing a claim under WIS. STAT. \u00a7 100.18(1), and that the contract's \"as is\" clause is limited by the contract's Limited Warranty which, if breached, does permit Peterson to pursue a claim for consequential damages. Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed with respect to the WIS. STAT. \u00a7 100.18(1) claim, and reversed in part with respect to consequential damages.\n\nI. BACKGROUND.\n\u00b6 4 In August 2000, Peterson entered into a reservation agreement with Cornerstone, paying $2,000 for the right to make the first offer for the purchase of a luxury condominium located at 1801 North Commerce Street in Milwaukee. In April 2001, Peterson made an offer to purchase the condominium unit for $292,199.89, and in May, Cornerstone made a counter-offer which Peterson accepted. The closing took place on May 18, 2001. The counter-offer, consisting of multiple documents, together with Peterson's offer, became the purchase contract between Peterson and Cornerstone.\n\u00b6 5 Peterson agreed to purchase the condominium at a reduced price \"in an `as is' condition.\" She agreed to complete the construction herself, and she knew that a *720 certificate of occupancy would not be issued until the construction was complete. Prior to the closing, Peterson was given the opportunity to inspect the property.\n\u00b6 6 Exhibit E contained a \"Limited Warranty,\" promising that for one year the unit would be free from \"latent defects due to faulty materials or workmanship,\" that is, defects not apparent at the time of the closing or completion of the work, but that become apparent before the expiration of the warranty. If such latent defects were discovered, Cornerstone would have the choice to either make the repairs or replace the defective item. With the exception of the Limited Warranty, Peterson specifically agreed to \"waive[] any claim against the Seller for patent or latent defects in construction of the Property.\"\n\u00b6 7 The contract included an integration clause, expressed in three separate provisions, excluding all prior negotiations from the contract and specifying that only the text contained in the written documents constituted the actual contract. First, in what was originally part of Peterson's offer, the contract provided: \"ENTIRE CONTRACT This Offer, including any amendments to it, contains the entire agreement of the Buyer and Seller regarding the transaction. All prior negotiations and discussions have been merged into this Offer.\" Next, Exhibit D, which was part of Cornerstone's counter-offer, provides: \"Seller has made no representations other than written in this offer and attached documents concerning the property.\" Finally, Exhibit F contained the following language:\nThe Buyer acknowledges, subject to the Limited Warranty contained in Exhibit E . . ., that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, . . . (c) other than those written representations concerning the condition of the Property contained in the Condominium Offer to purchase, including the Exhibits annexed thereto, she has not relied on any representations made by the Seller in entering into the Condominium Offer to Purchase. . . .\n\u00b6 8 In addition, Revised Exhibit A provided a list of tasks which Cornerstone agreed to fulfill prior to or at the closing, including completing certain unfinished tasks, making certain repairs, and supplying certain materials. Peterson and Cornerstone agreed that should Cornerstone fail to fulfill those obligations, Peterson would receive 150% of the cost of the work and materials. Cornerstone failed to provide the work and materials, and at the closing, the parties agreed that the value of the materials and work that Cornerstone had failed to provide was $2,259.00. Cornerstone made an offer for 150% of $2,259.00, amounting to a total of $3,388.50. Peterson rejected the offer.\n\u00b6 9 According to Peterson, Cornerstone made certain representations to her to induce her to purchase the unit, on which she relied in making her decision to buy it, including: that the property was fit for its intended purpose, well constructed, and, upon completion, ready for occupancy. According to Peterson, the unit did not meet these criteria, and was instead \"poorly designed and constructed,\" and caused her to be unable to complete the required construction. Having failed to complete the construction, Peterson was unable to obtain a certificate of occupancy, and was therefore unable to move into the condominium.\n\u00b6 10 On April 26, 2002, Peterson filed suit against Cornerstone,[3] alleging five different *721 causes of action. Her complaint alleged breach of contract for Cornerstone's failure to provide a unit that was \"well constructed, fit for its intended purpose and, except for final completion, ready for occupancy,\" and for failure to provide the materials and make the repairs as agreed, prior to or at the closing. As a result of the alleged breaches, Peterson claimed she had \"sustained damages, including consequential damages, in an amount to be determined.\" Peterson's complaint also alleged claims of negligent, intentional and strict responsibility misrepresentation. Lastly, she also claimed that Cornerstone had engaged in false advertising by making representations and omissions that were \"untrue, deceptive or misleading,\" in violation of WIS. STAT. \u00a7 100.18(1).\n\u00b6 11 Cornerstone filed an answer denying the allegations and asserting a number of affirmative defenses, including that: (1) Peterson's complaint had failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted; (2) Peterson had failed to mitigate damages; (3) Peterson's misrepresentation and WIS. STAT. \u00a7 100.18(1) claims were barred by the economic loss doctrine; and (4) Peterson's claims were barred by her own breach of contract because she accepted the condominium \"as is,\" subject only to the Limited Warranty and the delivery of certain materials and work, yet she refused to accept Cornerstone's offer for the materials and work, in the amount agreed to in the contract.\n\u00b6 12 Following extensive discovery, Cornerstone moved for summary judgment, arguing that: (1) the integration clause bars Peterson's claims of misrepresentation; (2) the economic loss doctrine bars all claims for misrepresentation; (3) Peterson's remedies under the contract are limited to those provided by the Limited Warranty and the value of the unsupplied materials agreed to at the closing; and (4) Cornerstone did not violate WIS. STAT. \u00a7 100.18(1) because Peterson must demonstrate an \"untrue, deceptive or misleading\" advertisement or announcement and Cornerstone did not make any such statements.\n\u00b6 13 Peterson filed a response, arguing that: (1) a genuine issue of material fact existed; (2) the economic loss doctrine does not bar all claims of misrepresentation because it does not apply to intentional or strict responsibility misrepresentation; (3) the integration clause does not bar claims of misrepresentation; (4) her contract remedies are not limited to the Limited Warranty; and (5) pre-contract representations are actionable under WIS. STAT. \u00a7 100.18(1) and the economic loss doctrine does not apply to \u00a7 100.18(1) actions.\n\u00b6 14 On March 31, 2003, the trial court denied Cornerstone's motion for summary judgment. The court was not convinced that the economic loss doctrine barred intentional misrepresentation or strict responsibility claims, and ruled that Peterson was not limited to her breach of contract claim. The court noted that summary judgment was also not appropriate because \"integration clauses which negate the existence of any representation not incorporated into the contract may not be used to escape liability for misrepresentations.\"\n\u00b6 15 On June 3, 2003, the supreme court issued its decision in Digicorp, Inc. v. Ameritech Corp., 2003 WI 54, 262 Wis.2d 32, 662 N.W.2d 652. Soon thereafter, Cornerstone filed a motion to reconsider the court's denial of its motion for summary judgment, maintaining that because Digicorp recognized that a fraud in the inducement exception to the economic loss doctrine applies only when the \"fraud is extraneous to, rather than interwoven *722 with, the contract,\" 262 Wis.2d 32, \u00b6 47, 662 N.W.2d 652, and because here the alleged misrepresentation is interwoven with the contract, Peterson's intentional misrepresentation claim is barred by the economic loss doctrine. Cornerstone also argued that the court had misapplied the law in concluding that the integration clause did not bar non-contract claims and maintained that it bars false advertising claims under WIS. STAT. \u00a7 100.18(1).\n\u00b6 16 Peterson filed a response, arguing that her situation falls under the fraud in the inducement exception outlined in Digicorp because before she entered into the contract, \"certain representations were made that were and are not addressed in the contract.\" She also asserted that Cornerstone misreads the law because integration clauses may not be used to escape liability under WIS. STAT. \u00a7 100.18(1).\n\u00b6 17 On October 7, 2003, the court issued a written decision and order granting Cornerstone's motion to reconsider. The court concluded that Peterson's intentional misrepresentation claim was barred by the economic loss doctrine as explained in Digicorp, and that her WIS. STAT. \u00a7 100.18 claim was barred by the integration clause, granting Cornerstone summary judgment as to those claims. The court explained that Peterson could still pursue a breach of contract claim.\n\u00b6 18 Meanwhile, Cornerstone had also filed a motion in limine to exclude evidence of consequential damages with respect to the breach of contract claim because Peterson purchased her condominium \"as is\" and had agreed that the total amount of damages for failure to supply the required materials and work was $3,388.50. Cornerstone submitted that the court should limit Peterson's contractual damages to $3,388.50 because her inability to gain occupancy of her condominium was due to her own inaction, not Cornerstone's action, and because she has failed to adequately itemize the alleged damages.\n\u00b6 19 Peterson responded by arguing that consequential damages are available, irrespective of the \"as is\" clause, both for the cost to complete the condominium and as damages for her inability to use it,[4] because the contract is ambiguous. In a supplemental brief, Peterson referred to the tasks, repairs and materials listed in Revised Exhibit A and the Limited Warranty promising that the unit would be free of latent defects and claimed that Cornerstone had failed to meet those obligations, amounting to a breach, that entitles her to recover consequential damages.\n\u00b6 20 Cornerstone filed a supplemental brief in support of its motion in limine, reiterating its position that Peterson is owed only $3,388.50 and that consequential damages for the cost to complete the unit or for her inability to use her condominium are barred by Peterson's failure to mitigate damages, the \"as is\" clause, and other provisions of the contract that expressly preclude such claims.\n\u00b6 21 On July 21, 2004, the court issued a decision and order granting Cornerstone's motion in limine to exclude evidence of *723 consequential damages for the breach of contract claim. The court explained that a party could recover consequential damages if they were \"proximately caused by\" or \"flowed naturally from\" the breach and were within the contemplation of the parties at the time they entered into the contract. The court observed, however, that because this was an \"as is\" contract, the items a buyer may recover as consequential damages is limited, and concluded that because none of the items for which Peterson sought damages were included in the contract, such evidence was barred by the \"as is\" clause. The court also rejected Peterson's claim that the contract was ambiguous.\n\u00b6 22 With only the breach of contract claim remaining, and as a result of the court excluding evidence of consequential damages, the parties stipulated to the damages being $3,388.50 and judgment was entered against Cornerstone for that amount, and Cornerstone was awarded $3,594.93 in costs. This appeal follows.\n\nII. ANALYSIS.\n\u00b6 23 On appeal, Peterson pursues two issues: (1) whether the trial court erred in dismissing her claim based on a violation of WIS. STAT. \u00a7 100.18(1);[5] and (2) whether the trial court erred in excluding evidence of consequential damages with respect to her breach of contract claim.\n\nA. WISCONSIN STAT. \u00a7 100.18(1)\n\u00b6 24 Peterson contends that the trial court erred in granting Cornerstone's motion to reconsider, dismissing her claim under WIS. STAT. \u00a7 100.18, because it erroneously concluded that the economic loss doctrine and the contract's integration clause bar a \u00a7 100.18(1) claim.\n\u00b6 25 We review the grant or denial of a summary judgment de novo, employing the same methodology as the trial court. Spring Green Farms v. Kersten, 136 Wis.2d 304, 315-17, 401 N.W.2d 816 (1987). Summary judgment is proper if there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Id. at 315, 401 N.W.2d 816; WIS. STAT. \u00a7 802.08(2).\n\u00b6 26 WISCONSIN STAT \u00a7 100.18, entitled \"Fraudulent representations,\"[6] protects the public from all \"untrue, deceptive or misleading\" representations made in sales and promotions, including representations made in face-to-face sales. See, e.g., State v. Automatic Merchandisers of Am., Inc., 64 Wis.2d 659, 665, 221 N.W.2d 683 (1974); Bonn v. Haubrich, 123 Wis.2d 168, 173, 366 N.W.2d 503 (Ct.App.1985).\n*724 \u00b6 27 Peterson first responds to the trial court's conclusion that her WIS. STAT. \u00a7 100.18 claim is barred by the economic loss doctrine by pointing to Kailin v. Armstrong, 2002 WI App 70, 252 Wis.2d 676, 643 N.W.2d 132, which explicitly held that the economic loss doctrine does not bar \u00a7 100.18 claims. Kailin, 252 Wis.2d 676, \u00b6\u00b6 2, 43, 643 N.W.2d 132. In her reply, Peterson emphasizes the timing of when the allegedly misleading statements were made and asserts that \"if Cornerstone made the representations asserted by Ms. Peterson in inducing her to purchase the condominium it is actionable under Wis. Stat. 100.18(1),\" and that to prevail she must show only \"that as a covered member of the class the statute protects, Cornerstone[,] in inducing her to purchase the condominium[,] made a representation or representations which were untrue, deceptive or misleading resulting in her suffering damages.\"\n\u00b6 28 Addressing the trial court's second reason for dismissing her WIS. STAT. \u00a7 100.18 claim, Peterson submits that the integration clause does not bar a \u00a7 100.18 claim because \"[i]ntegration clauses cannot be used to escape liability for misrepresentations.\" She relies heavily on Grube v. Daun, 173 Wis.2d 30, 496 N.W.2d 106 (Ct. App.1992) for support, and cites it for the proposition that \"integration clauses do not negate representations which are not part of the written contract\" (underlining by Peterson). In her reply, continuing to cite Grube, she asserts that the integration clause \"cannot eliminate the protection [of] this statute and the remedy it affords\" because \"[t]he purpose of Wis. Stat. 100.18(1) is to protect individuals such as Ms. Peterson from just the type of untrue, deceptive and misleading misrepresentations she alleges were made to her by Cornerstone.\"\n\u00b6 29 Cornerstone responds by first conceding that the economic loss doctrine does not bar a WIS. STAT. \u00a7 100.18 claim and that an integration clause does not bar a misrepresentation claim,[7] but asserts that in arguing that integration clauses cannot be used to escape liability for misrepresentation, Peterson mistakenly combines her \u00a7 100.18 claim, the subject of this appeal, with her misrepresentation claim, which she elected not to appeal, \"to argue incorrectly as to the integration clause's ability to bar a [\u00a7 100.18] claim.\" Cornerstone asserts that Peterson's reliance on Grube heightens her error of combining the \u00a7 100.18(1) and misrepresentation claims because, unlike Peterson's contract, which explicitly precludes a reliance on a representation that is allegedly untrue, deceptive or misleading, the integration clause in Grube dealt with the phrase \"as is.\" Cornerstone submits that the integration clause here bars \u00a7 100.18(1) claims because Peterson never alleged that \"oral representations\" were incorporated into the contract to vary the terms of the written documents, and because there is no case law stating that an integration clause does not bar a \u00a7 100.18 claim.\n\u00b6 30 We begin by noting that Peterson correctly asserts, and Cornerstone properly concedes, that a WIS. STAT. *725 \u00a7 100.18(1) claim is not barred by the economic loss doctrine under Kailin, 252 Wis.2d 676, \u00b6 43, 643 N.W.2d 132 (\"We conclude the economic loss doctrine does not apply to claims under WIS. STAT. 100.18.\"). We therefore need not address the economic loss doctrine further. Consequently, the only issue before us is whether the contract's integration clause bars a \u00a7 100.18(1) claim. We conclude that it does.\n\u00b6 31 The general rule is that when a contract includes an integration clause, evidence of contemporaneous or prior oral agreements relating to the same subject matter are not admissible. Matthew v. American Family Mut. Ins. Co., 54 Wis.2d 336, 341-42, 195 N.W.2d 611 (1972). In conjunction with the parol evidence rule,[8] an integration clause generally bars the introduction of extrinsic evidence to \"vary or contradict the terms of a writing.\" Ziegler Co. v. Rexnord, Inc., 139 Wis.2d 593, 608-09 n. 11, 407 N.W.2d 873 (1987). Absent claims of duress, fraud, or mutual mistake, integration clauses are given effect. See, e.g., Matthew, 54 Wis.2d at 341-42, 195 N.W.2d 611 (giving effect to integration clause).\n\u00b6 32 In Grube, cited by Peterson, this court discussed the applicability of integration clauses. Grube involved the sale of a farm in an \"as is\" condition, where the purchasers sued the real estate broker, seller, previous owner, and the previous owner's liability insurer for making allegedly untrue assertions about the property and for failing to disclose the existence of an underground gasoline tank that was later found to have caused groundwater contamination. Id., 173 Wis.2d at 46-47, 496 N.W.2d 106. The purchasers alleged negligence, intentional misrepresentation, strict liability for misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation and deceptive or misleading advertisement in violation of WIS. STAT. \u00a7 100.18. Grube, 173 Wis.2d at 47-48, 496 N.W.2d 106. The trial court granted summary judgment on all five counts and the purchasers appealed. Id. at 49, 496 N.W.2d 106.\n\u00b6 33 On appeal, this court discussed the integration clause, phrased as an \"as is\" clause, and addressed the question of \"whether an `as is' clause shields the seller and his agent only from breach of warranty claims in contract, or also from tort claims based on misrepresentation.\" Id. at 59, 496 N.W.2d 106. We acknowledged that \"Wisconsin follows the general rule that integration clauses which negate the existence of any representations not incorporated into the contract may not be used to escape liability for the misrepresentations[,]\" id. at 59-60, 496 N.W.2d 106, ultimately reversing the order granting summary judgment on the misrepresentation claim, id. at 62, 496 N.W.2d 106.\n\u00b6 34 In another discussion, separate from our analysis involving the \"as is\" clause, we addressed the remaining cause of action based on a violation of WIS. STAT. \u00a7 100.18. We concluded that the defendants had not provided any basis for a prime facie defense and therefore also allowed that claim to go forward. Grube, 173 Wis.2d at 62-63, 496 N.W.2d 106.\n*726 \u00b6 35 Peterson's reliance on Grube is misplaced. She apparently fails to realize that although Grube did involve a WIS. STAT. \u00a7 100.18(1) claim, the portions she cites for support address the applicability of the \"as is\" clause as a bar to common law misrepresentation claims, not a \u00a7 100.18 claim. See Grube, 173 Wis.2d at 59, 496 N.W.2d 106. Because Peterson elected not to appeal her misrepresentation claims, she cannot now rely on Grube's holding that integration clauses do not bar misrepresentation claims to support her arguments that she should be allowed to bring a \u00a7 100.18 claim.\n\u00b6 36 However, even if the holding from Grube is applied to Peterson's statutory claim, Grube is still easily distinguishable because Peterson overlooks an important distinction between the integration clause in her contact and the one in Grube. In Grube, we noted that to be effective, disclaimers in the form of integration clauses will not be honored, as matter of public policy, unless the disclaimer is specific as to the tort that is being disclaimed and the disclaimer makes it \"apparent that an express bargain was struck to forego the possibility of tort recovery in exchange for negotiated alternative economic damages.\" 173 Wis.2d at 60, 496 N.W.2d 106 (citing Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Bucyrus-Erie Co., 131 Wis.2d 21, 33, 388 N.W.2d 584 (1986)). Stated differently, although exculpatory clauses are closely scrutinized and void if they violate public policy, Mettler ex rel. Burnett v. Nellis, 2005 WI App 73, \u00b6 13, 280 Wis.2d 753, 695 N.W.2d 861, they are enforceable so long as they \"clearly, unambiguously, and unmistakably inform the signer of what is being waived,\" Yauger v. Skiing Enters., Inc., 206 Wis.2d 76, 84, 557 N.W.2d 60 (1996).\n\u00b6 37 The integration clause in Grube was merely an \"as is\" clause, stating: \"Buyer is buying the property in a [sic] as is condition without any warranties.\" Grube, 173 Wis.2d at 47, 496 N.W.2d 106 (bracketing in Grube). In Peterson's contract, by contrast, three different provisions expressed that all prior negotiations were excluded and that only the text of the written documents constituted the contract: \"This Offer, including any amendments to it, contains the entire agreement of the Buyer and Seller regarding the transaction. All prior negotiations and discussion have been merged into this Offer\"; \"Seller has made no representations other than written in this offer and attached documents concerning the property\"; and finally:\nThe Buyer acknowledges, subject to the Limited Warranty contained in Exhibit E . . . (c) other than those written representations concerning the condition of the Property contained in the Condominium Offer to purchase, including the Exhibits annexed thereto, she has not relied on any representations made by the Seller in entering into the Condominium Offer to Purchase . . . .\n(Emphasis added.) Thus, unlike the clause in Grube, the integration clause here specifically disclaims the purchaser's right to rely on any alleged fraudulent misrepresentations. Indeed, the three provisions of Peterson's contract that expressly stated that the written contract made up the entire contract, to the exclusion of all other provisions, provide exactly the kind of specific disclaimer that makes it apparent that an express bargain had been struck. See Grube, 173 Wis.2d at 60, 496 N.W.2d 106. With an integration clause, worded as clearly and unmistakably as the one in question, we see no reason not to give the integration clause its intended effect.\n\u00b6 38 We are also not convinced by Peterson's emphasis on the timing of the alleged statements and her argument that they occurred before the purchase was completed *727 and that she therefore was induced into purchasing the condominium. In addition to being precluded by the reasons already discussed, she appears to misstate the applicable law. In Grube, we concluded that \"while the `as is' [integration] clause is not a complete bar\" to claims of negligence and misrepresentation, unless the seller makes affirmative misrepresentations, the clause shifts the burden to the buyer to determine the condition of the property:\n[T]he \"as is\" clause put[s] the burden upon a buyer to determine the condition of the property purchased. This shifting of the burden, with nothing more, protects a seller and his or her agent from claims premised upon nondisclosure. But we hold that once the seller or his agent has made an affirmative representation about some aspect of the property, the buyer is entitled to rely upon that statement and expect full and fair disclosure of all material facts relating to that aspect of the property.\nId. at 61, 496 N.W.2d 106 (citations omitted; emphasis in original). In Grube, the defendants made an untrue statement about wells that turned out to be contaminated, and it was this affirmative representation that constituted a viable WIS. STAT. \u00a7 100.18 claim. Grube, 173 Wis.2d at 62, 496 N.W.2d 106.\n\u00b6 39 Here, Peterson does not dispute that she was given the opportunity, and in fact did, inspect the property prior to entering into the purchase contract. She therefore had to show that Cornerstone made affirmative representations upon which she relied. Unlike the situation in Grube, Peterson never provided affidavits alleging that she inquired about the property, and that Cornerstone made an affirmative representation in response to her inquiry. She likewise never provided affidavits alleging that she did not get the property in the condition in which she agreed to purchase it. In fact, Peterson continually states only that Cornerstone made \"representations and omissions\" that entitle her to relief under WIS. STAT. \u00a7 100.18(1), but she fails to specify what those alleged representations or omissions were or even reference portions of the record to indicate exactly what she is referring to.[9] Because Peterson chose to go forward with the closing, having inspected the property, and because she has failed to identify the representations that she alleges were false, she cannot now allege false advertising.\n\u00b6 40 Accordingly, the integration clause governs and bars Peterson's claim under WIS. STAT. \u00a7 100.18(1).[10]\n\nB. Consequential Damages\n\u00b6 41 Peterson also contends that the trial court erred in granting Cornerstone's motion in limine to exclude evidence of consequential damages regarding her breach of contract claim because it erroneously concluded that the fact that she purchased her condominium \"as is\" bars consequential damages.\n\u00b6 42 \"We review a circuit court's decision to admit or exclude evidence *728 under an erroneous exercise of discretion standard.\" Martindale v. Ripp, 2001 WI 113, \u00b6 28, 246 Wis.2d 67, 629 N.W.2d 698 (citations omitted). However, when the exercise of such discretion turns upon a question of law, we review the question de novo, benefiting from the trial court's analysis. Gulmire v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co., 2004 WI App 18, \u00b6 10, 269 Wis.2d 501, 674 N.W.2d 629. Here, we are asked to interpret the purchase contract to determine whether it allows for the recovery of consequential damages, which is a question of law. See Ford Motor Co. v. Lyons, 137 Wis.2d 397, 460, 405 N.W.2d 354 (Ct.App.1987). Whether the terms of a written contract are ambiguous is also a question of law that we review de novo. Wisconsin Label Corp. v. Northbrook Prop. & Cas. Ins. Co., 2000 WI 26, \u00b6 24, 233 Wis.2d 314, 607 N.W.2d 276.\n\u00b6 43 Peterson contends that she should be allowed to introduce evidence of consequential damages because she asserts that, as a result of Cornerstone's breach of contract, she is entitled to recover such damages. She maintains that Cornerstone breached the contract by failing to: provide a unit fit for its intended purpose, well constructed and upon her completion ready for occupancy; perform repairs and construction and provide materials prior to or at the closing, as agreed in Revised Exhibit A; provide a unit free from latent defects, as promised in the Limited Warranty; and assume the responsibilities agreed upon in the Limited Warranty in the event a latent defect was discovered. Peterson asserts that these breaches and failures entitle her to recover consequential damages.\n\u00b6 44 Responding to whether the contract's \"as is\" clause bars her from recovering consequential damages, Peterson submits that the contract is ambiguous because it contains an \"as is\" clause, as well as a Limited Warranty, and a clause assuring that Cornerstone would fulfill certain obligations prior to or at the closing (Revised Exhibit A), and that the these conflicting provisions cannot be applied harmoniously. Peterson notes that while Cornerstone could have inserted an \"as is\" clause without a warranty or promising to meet other obligations, or provided specific disclaimers effecting warranties and damages, Cornerstone did not. Peterson further submits that the only way to harmonize these provisions is by giving meaning to either the \"as is\" clause or the Limited Warranty and Revised Exhibit A, and citing Goldmann Trust v. Goldmann, 26 Wis.2d 141, 131 N.W.2d 902 (1965), for the proposition that \"[s]pecific provisions of a contract take precedence over conflicting general provisions,\" she argues that the \"as is\" clause cannot be given meaning. Referring to the \"as is\" clause as a \"poor boilerplate effort . . . to shift responsibility\" to her, Peterson asserts that:\nThe \"as is\" clause has no realistic meaning or effect given the specific provisions of Revised Exhibit A and Exhibit E. These specific provisions must be given effect for them to be meaningfully enforceable contractual provisions. These provisions either created an exception to the \"as is\" clause or negated it completely. Cornerstone's breach of either or both gave rise to a breach of contract claim for which consequential damages are recoverable.\n\u00b6 45 Cornerstone responds that the trial court correctly barred Peterson from introducing evidence of consequential damages, and that the only money Peterson should recover is the $3,388.00 the parties agreed to at the closing.\n\u00b6 46 Cornerstone first notes that Peterson fails to identify the damages she believes constitute consequential damages. Cornerstone then maintains that the contract *729 itself explicitly limits her right to collect consequential damages for several reasons: with the exception of the items identified in the Limited Warranty, it bars her from recovering damages for patent and latent defects in the construction of the property; Peterson herself agreed at the closing that Cornerstone had no additional obligations to her, including the supply of labor, except those specifically agreed to in Revised Exhibit A; and the \"as is\" clause bars consequential damages because an \"as is\" clause puts the burden on a buyer to determine the condition of the property purchased.[11]\n\u00b6 47 We begin by addressing the \"as is\" clause and by examining whether the contract is ambiguous. In Omernik v. Bushman, 151 Wis.2d 299, 444 N.W.2d 409 (Ct.App.1989), we held that \"[a]n `as is' clause in a real estate contract puts the burden upon a buyer to determine the condition of the property purchased.\" Id. at 303, 444 N.W.2d 409. Similarly, as already noted in our discussion about the integration clause, Grube affirmed the same principle. 173 Wis.2d at 61, 496 N.W.2d 106. We agree with Peterson that the contract's more specific provisions, the Limited Warranty and Revised Exhibit A, do conflict with the \"as is\" clause, and we further agree that under Goldmann, the Limited Warranty and Revised Exhibit A should be given meaning. We disagree with Peterson, however, that the existence of a Limited Warranty and the additional obligations set forth in Revised Exhibit A render the \"as is\" clause meaningless. We also disagree that a contract that sells a property \"as is,\" yet provides a Limited Warranty and other obligations, is ambiguous: The only reasonable interpretation of this contract is that with the exception of the specific items covered by the Limited Warranty and Revised Exhibit A the condominium was sold \"as is.\" See, e.g., Jones v. Jenkins, 88 Wis.2d 712, 722, 277 N.W.2d 815 (1979) (\"A contract provision which is reasonably and fairly susceptible to more than one construction is ambiguous.\"). With respect to Revised Exhibit A, because the parties specifically agreed at the closing that the amount owed was $3,388.00, we see no reason to further discuss that provision. With respect to the Limited Warranty, by contrast, we conclude that because the \"as is\" clause is limited by the warranty, the Limited Warranty, if breached, does indeed permit a claim for consequential damages.\n\u00b6 48 Consequently, the items not covered by the Limited Warranty are subject to the \"as is\" provision, and with respect to those it was Peterson's responsibility to inspect the property prior to entering into the contract. See Omernik, 151 Wis.2d at 303, 444 N.W.2d 409. Peterson, as mentioned, was given the opportunity and did inspect the condominium and is therefore precluded from claiming consequential damages for the items that fall under the \"as is\" clause. The question therefore becomes what the Limited Warranty covers.\n\u00b6 49 First, a major problem with Peterson's argument is that in her appellate briefs she fails to specify what the damages *730 she alleges stem from. Indeed, she fails to even provide a dollar amount.[12] Earlier in the proceeding, however, Peterson had specified eleven different areas for which she was seeking consequential damages. Referring to the trial court's ruling excluding consequential damages, her brief-in-chief in fact references \"eleven categories of Ms. Peterson's claimed damages,\" yet she fails to elaborate on what those categories are or explain whether she is still seeking consequential damages for those same categories. What seems to be the most recent list of consequential damages sought by Peterson appears in her Pretrial Report, also presented at a hearing on May 18, 2004, which indicates the following eight categories of damages: (1) mortgage payments of $1,670.00 per month since September 2001; (2) condominium dues since September 2001; (3) real estate taxes since September 2001; (4) storage fees since August 2001; (5) $28,432.28 for undelivered materials; (6) square footage adjustment due to Peterson's misunderstanding as to the size of the unit; (7) $33,373.00 to complete the unit; and (8) Peterson's share of any assessment to repair common elements. We will assume that these are still the damages currently sought by Peterson.\n\u00b6 50 Assuming that Peterson is in fact still seeking the same damages she reported in her Pretrial Report, much of her claim is still problematic. In general, the amount of consequential damages to which a party is entitled \"is limited to such damages as are the natural and probable consequences of the breach and were within contemplation of the parties when the contract was made.\" General Star Indem. Co. v. Bankruptcy Estate of Lake Geneva Sugar Shack, Inc., 215 Wis.2d 104, 119-20, 572 N.W.2d 881 (Ct.App.1997). The damages must \"flow directly and necessarily from the breach of contract, and must be reasonably foreseeable at the time the contract was made as a probable result of the breach.\" Reiman Assocs., Inc. v. R/A Adver., Inc., 102 Wis.2d 305, 321, 306 N.W.2d 292 (Ct.App.1981); see also WIS JI\u0097CIVIL 3710. In addition, under general principles of contract law, \"[a]n injured party is entitled to the benefit of his agreement, which is the net gain he would have realized from the contract but for the failure of the other party to perform[,]\" Thorp Sales Corp. v. Gyuro Grading Co., 111 Wis.2d 431, 438-39, 331 N.W.2d 342 (1983), however, \"[a] party is not entitled to be placed in a better position because of a breach than he would have if the contract had been performed,\" Hanz Trucking, Inc. v. Harris Bros. Co., 29 Wis.2d 254, 268, 138 N.W.2d 238 (1965).\n\u00b6 51 Here, the only contract provision that mentioned damages was the Limited Warranty, and therefore the only damages that Peterson may recover are ones resulting from \"latent defects due to faulty materials or workmanship.\" Because these were the only damages contemplated by the parties at the time they entered into the contract, any other damages do not meet the definition of consequential damages. See General Star, 215 Wis.2d at *731 119-20, 572 N.W.2d 881. It follows that damages for mortgage payments, condominium dues, real estate taxes, storage fees, square footage adjustment, and the cost to complete the unit, are not included as none of these come close to being covered by the Limited Warranty. Particularly baffling is Peterson's demand that she be compensated for the cost of completing the unit, since the contract explicitly provided that she would complete the construction, and it was clearly understood that she was allowed to purchase the unit for a lower price in exchange for completing the construction herself.\n\u00b6 52 Nonetheless, because at this point it is unclear what exactly Peterson is seeking, we conclude that such general descriptions as undelivered materials\u0097 with the exception of those already covered by Revised Exhibit A\u0097and Peterson's share of any assessment to repair common elements, could potentially qualify as \"latent defects due to faulty materials or workmanship.\" Therefore, Peterson may pursue consequential damages under her breach of contract claim, with respect to damage stemming from the alleged breach of the Limited Warranty. We emphasize that only damages resulting from \"latent defects due to faulty materials and workmanship\" are included, and that this narrow definition in particular does not include the cost to complete the property, mortgage payments, real estate taxes, storage fees, or the like.\n\u00b6 53 Moreover, another important consideration in determining damages is that \"[t]he party alleging breach of the contract has a duty to mitigate damages, that is, `to use reasonable means under the circumstances to avoid or minimize the damages.'\" Kramer v. Board of Educ. of the Sch. Dist. of the Menomonie Area, 2001 WI App 244, \u00b6 13, 248 Wis.2d 333, 635 N.W.2d 857 (citing Kuhlman, Inc. v. G. Heileman Brewing Co., 83 Wis.2d 749, 752, 266 N.W.2d 382 (1978)). \"An injured party cannot recover any item of damage that could have been, or was, avoided.\" Id.; see also WIS JI\u0097CIVIL 1731. Cornerstone contends that Peterson failed to mitigate or even attempt to mitigate her alleged inability to use the condominium, and therefore should not be allowed to recover the consequential damages she seeks. For instance, to obtain a certificate of occupancy Peterson was required to install a kitchen sink, but apparently fearing that the sink would sustain damage from the yet to be completed construction, she refused to install the sink and is now claiming damages because she was unable to live in her condominium. Cornerstone notes that although she could have, for instance, covered up the sink, \"Peterson made a conscious, yet expensive choice, to incur damages for her alleged inability to occupy the property.\" Because the law requires mitigation, should Peterson's breach of contract claim under the Limited Warranty succeed, in subsequently determining Peterson's damages, it will be necessary to determine whether she satisfactorily mitigated her damages.\n\u00b6 54 In sum, we affirm the order dismissing Peterson's claim based on a violation of WIS. STAT. \u00a7 100.18; we affirm the judgment awarding Peterson $3,388.00 for breach for contract, for damages under Revised Exhibit A; and we reverse the order granting Cornerstone a motion in limine to exclude evidence of consequential damages under the breach of contract claim with respect to the Limited Warranty only, and affirm the order with respect to all other claims for damages.\nJudgment affirmed in part; reversed in part and cause remanded with directions.\nNOTES\n[2]  All references to the Wisconsin Statutes are to the 2003-04 version unless otherwise noted.\n[3]  Peterson's suit also initially included a claim against Timothy Dixon, the Cornerstone representative who handled the sale of the condominium; however, the parties subsequently stipulated to the voluntary dismissal of that claim without prejudice.\n[4]  Peterson originally sought consequential damages for eleven separate areas; however, her Pretrial Report and a hearing on May 18, 2004, reduced the damages that she sought, to the following eight areas: (1) mortgage payments of $1,670.00 per month since September 2001; (2) condominium dues since September 2001; (3) real estate taxes since September 2001; (4) storage fees since August 2001; (5) $28,432.28 for undelivered materials; (6) square footage adjustment due to Peterson's misunderstanding as to the size of the unit; (7) $33,373.00 to complete the unit; and (8) Peterson's share of any assessment to repair common elements. Whether this is an accurate list of the consequential damages that Peterson is still seeking is unclear because her briefs do not address the issue.\n[5]  Although the summary judgment encompassed not only Peterson's WIS. STAT. \u00a7 100.18(1) claim, but also her claims of misrepresentation, she appeals only the dismissal of her \u00a7 100.18(1) claim.\n[6]  WISCONSIN STAT. \u00a7 100.18, provides in relevant part:\n\nFraudulent representations. (1) No person, firm, corporation or association, or agent or employee thereof, with intent to sell, any real estate or with intent to induce the public in any manner to enter into any contract or obligation relating to the purchase [or] sale of any real estate shall make, publish, disseminate, circulate, or place before the public in this state, in a newspaper, magazine or other publication, or in the form of a book, notice, handbill, poster, bill, circular, pamphlet, letter, sign, placard, card, label, or over any radio or television station, or in any other way similar or dissimilar to the foregoing, an advertisement, announcement, statement or representation of any kind to the public relating to such purchase [or] sale of such real estate or to the terms or conditions thereof, which advertisement, announcement, statement or representation contains any assertion, representation or statement of fact which is untrue, deceptive or misleading.\n[7]  At oral argument, Cornerstone argued that as a result of subsequent developments in the economic loss doctrine in Wisconsin, specifically Kaloti Enters., Inc. v. Kellogg Sales Co., 2005 WI 111, 283 Wis.2d 555, 699 N.W.2d 205, the economic loss doctrine may in fact bar a WIS. STAT. \u00a7 100.18 claim and hence trump contrary language in Kailin v. Armstrong, 2002 WI App 70, 252 Wis.2d 676, 643 N.W.2d 132. Because we conclude that Peterson's \u00a7 100.18 claim is barred by the integration clause, we do not further address the possible applicability of the economic loss doctrine.\n[8]  The parol evidence rule can be stated as follows:\n\nWhen the parties to a contract embody their agreement in writing and intend the writing to be the final expression of their agreement, the terms of the writing may not be varied or contradicted by evidence of any prior written or oral agreement in the absence of fraud, duress, or mutual mistake.\nFederal Deposit Ins. Corp. v. First Mortgage Investors, 76 Wis.2d 151, 156, 250 N.W.2d 362 (1977) (footnote omitted).\n[9]  Curiously, despite extensive discovery and ample time, Peterson repeatedly refers to the allegations she made in her complaint.\n[10]  If one party to a contract with a disclaimer, integration clause, or similar provision lacks the sophistication in business matters or possesses unequal bargaining power, this provides a basis for voiding that clause. See, e.g., Finch v. Southside Lincoln-Mercury, Inc., 2004 WI App 110, \u00b6 22, 274 Wis.2d 719, 685 N.W.2d 154. Here, however, because Peterson was represented by an attorney throughout the entire proceeding, she cannot be said to have lacked the necessary sophistication or to have been disadvantaged by unequal bargaining power.\n[11]  Cornerstone also contends that consequential damages for the loss of the property's appreciated value are barred as a matter of law because Peterson \"cannot allege a fraud in the contract formation and avoid its integration clause, yet seek benefit of the bargain damages.\" We decline to address the issue of consequential damages for the loss of the property's appreciated value because it appears as though Peterson is no longer seeking such damages. Although a claim for lost appreciation was among the eleven alleged damages she originally brought, her Pretrial Report did not mention such damages and neither do her appellate briefs.\n[12]  In fact, the closest she comes to explaining the alleged damages is on the last page of her reply brief in attacking Cornerstone's assertion that she should have put in her kitchen sink when she notes:\n\nCornerstone over simplifies the condition of Ms. Peterson's unit. It wasn't just the sink. It was poor construction including significant roof issues, ceiling construction, heating and air conditioning design and execution, water leakage and mold. The unit was because of these problems rendered uninhabitable. Ms. Peterson has expended substantial dollars attempting to make the unit habitable.\nThese brief mentions of what she actually alleges was wrong with her unit were not accompanied by citations to the record.\n", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "FreeLaw"}}

{"text": "The majority of present day integrated circuits (ICs) are implemented by using a plurality of interconnected field effect transistors (FETs), also called metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs or MOS transistors). The ICs are usually formed using both P-channel and N-channel FETs and the IC is then referred to as a complementary MOS or CMOS circuit. Certain improvements in performance of FET ICs can be realized by forming the FETs in a thin layer of semiconductor material overlying an insulator layer. Such semiconductor on insulator (SOI) FETs, for example, exhibit lower junction capacitance and hence can operate at higher speeds. It is advantageous in certain applications, however, to fabricate at least some devices in the semiconductor substrate that supports the insulator layer. The devices formed in the substrate, for example, may have better thermal properties and can support higher voltages than devices formed in the thin semiconductor layer.\nAs the complexity of the integrated circuits increases, more and more MOS transistors are needed to implement the integrated circuit function. As more and more transistors are designed into the IC, it becomes important to shrink the size of individual MOS transistors so that the size of the IC remains reasonable and the IC can be reliably manufactured. Shrinking the size of an MOS transistor implies that the minimum feature size, that is, the minimum width of a line or the minimum spacing between lines, is reduced. MOS transistors have now been aggressively reduced to the point at which the gate electrode of the transistor is less than or equal to 45 nanometers (nm) in width. Methods previously used to fabricate devices in the substrate of an SOI structure, however, have not be able to achieve the same minimum feature size in substrate devices as are realized in the devices formed in the thin semiconductor layer.\nAccordingly, it is desirable to provide a method for fabricating SOI devices having minimum feature size. In addition, it is desirable to provide a self aligned method for fabricating SOI devices having minimum feature size substrate devices. Furthermore, other desirable features and characteristics of the present invention will become apparent from the subsequent detailed description and the appended claims, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and the foregoing technical field and background.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "USPTO Backgrounds"}}
{"text": "Background {#Sec1}\n==========\n\nThe clinical importance of lumbar disc degeneration as measured on MRI remains controversial and uncertain. This may in part be due to the challenges in accurately and reproducibly measuring disc degeneration. Most studies investigating disc degeneration use a subjective assessment which categorize discs into different levels of degeneration. The most widely used assessment of disc degeneration is the 5-grade classification system of disc degeneration proposed by Pfirrmann et al. ([@CR10]). This grading system is primarily based on changes in signal intensity, distinction between nucleus and annulus fibrosis and disc height (Pfirrmann et al. [@CR10]; Niu et al. [@CR9]). The scale lacks sensitivity to change and has only moderate to good reliability (Videman et al. [@CR15]; Borthakur et al. [@CR2]).\n\nTo overcome some of these limitations quantitative measures of disc degeneration on MRI have been developed and used. These quantitative measures most commonly include measurement of the signal intensity of nucleus pulposus and the disc height (Videman et al. [@CR16]; Tunset et al. [@CR13]; Watanabe et al. [@CR19]; Niemel\u00e4inen et al. [@CR8]). Quantitative measurements are generally reported to have excellent reliability (Videman et al. [@CR16]; Teichtahl et al. [@CR12]) and are more sensitive to change than traditional subjective scales. These quantitative measures may be important in future research investigating the potential relationship between disc degeneration on MRI and current or future low back pain; however, little is known about the validity of these measures and how they relate to the widely used subjective assessments.\n\nTo be useful in assessing the clinical importance of MRI findings, measures must be capable of comparing between individuals as well as within individuals over time. It is questionable if quantitative measures of disc degeneration can be validly used for this purpose. For example, it is unclear if it is reasonable to compare quantitative measures of disc height between 2 individuals who have very different overall height. Do quantitative measures of disc height relate to the subjective measures of disc degeneration made on MRI scans which may be influenced by other factors such as adjacent discs and vertebral body height? Similarly quantitative measures of disc signal are commonly adjusted for local cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to allow for local variations in image intensity both within a single image and between different images (Videman et al. [@CR17]). There has been limited investigation of the validity of these measures between patients or the relationship with subjective measures of disc degeneration.\n\nTherefore, the primary aim of the current study was to assess the relationship between quantitative measures of disc height and disc signal intensity with Pfirrmann scores and to investigate whether different methods of assessing these variables influenced the relationship. We also wished to investigate the inter-rater reliability of the quantitative measures of disc height and disc signal intensity.\n\nMethods {#Sec2}\n=======\n\nThis study used baseline data from a previous cohort study investigating whether MRI findings predicted time to a recurrence of low back pain in 76 participants who had recently recovered from a previous episode of low back pain (Hancock et al. The Spine journal, accepted July 2015) (Hancock et al. [@CR4]). The study was approved by Macquarie University Human Ethics Committee.\n\nParticipants {#Sec3}\n------------\n\nParticipants were included if they had recovered from a previous episode of acute, non-specific LBP (pain in the area between the 12th rib and buttock crease, with or without leg pain) within the last 3\u00a0months. The date of recovery was defined as the 30th consecutive day with pain no greater than 1 on a 0--10 scale. Exclusion criteria included: previous spinal surgery, contraindication to MRI or being unable to complete follow-up electronically for the cohort study.\n\nMRI examination {#Sec4}\n---------------\n\nAll participants underwent a Lumbar Spine MRI scan on a single high field strength system (3.0 Tesla Siemens Verio) with a multichannel phased array spine surface coil. A standardized protocol was used for all participants, which included sagittal fast spin-echo T1 (TR 650\u00a0ms, TE 6.3\u00a0ms) and T2 (TR 4500\u00a0ms, TE 101\u00a0ms), sagittal STIR (TR 3800\u00a0ms, TE 35\u00a0ms, IR 215\u00a0ms) and axial T2 (TR 5000\u00a0ms, TE 116\u00a0ms) scans. All sequences were 4\u00a0mm thick with a 1\u00a0mm inter-slice space. Sagittal sequences used a 320\u00a0mm FOV and axial 200\u00a0mm (Hancock et al. [@CR4]).\n\nMRI measures (Pfirrmann scores) {#Sec5}\n-------------------------------\n\nA single, experienced radiologist rated disc degeneration for all lumbar levels in the participants (380 disc levels in total) based on Pfirrmann's score (Pfirrmann et al. [@CR10]), using the criteria listed in Table\u00a0[1](#Tab1){ref-type=\"table\"}. The intra-tester reliability was previously reported to be good (K\u00a0=\u00a00.86) (Hancock et al. The Spine journal, accepted July 2015) (Hancock et al. [@CR4]). The radiologist was blinded to the quantitative measures.Table\u00a01Pfirrmann disc degeneration grading system (Pfirrmann et al.

The measures were made by 2 of the researchers (JH and CK) who were both final year Physiotherapy students and blinded to the participants' details and Pfirrmann scores. Before starting quantitative measures they were trained by a radiologist (JM) on 2 occasions and practiced for 2\u00a0weeks using a highly standardized protocol until good reliability was achieved.\n\nInteleviewer, version 4.3.4, image analysis software was used to take quantitative measures of disc height and disc signal intensity on T2 midsagittal images. We investigated 3 different measures of disc height. These included 1) a raw disc height measure, 2) a ratio adjusted for each person's height (ratio 1) and 3) a ratio adjusted for height of the vertebral body above the disc (ratio 2). Raw disc height was measured by dividing the disc area by horizontal length (distance between anterior and posterior boundaries of intervertebral disc) in a manner similar to previous studies (Videman et al. [@CR18]). Disc area was defined by using the freehand region of interest measurement tool and tracing around the disc starting along the anterior longitudinal ligament, moving along the superior disc-vertebral interface, posterior longitudinal ligament and finally inferior disc-vertebral interface (Fig.\u00a0[1](#Fig1){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Ratio 1 was calculated by dividing the raw disc height for each vertebral level by the total body height of the participant. Ratio 2 was calculated by dividing the raw disc height by the height of the vertebral body above the disc. The height of the vertebral body above was calculated in a similar manner to disc height.Fig.\u00a01MRI tracing for quantitative measures of disc height and disc signal intensity. The *shaded region* represents the area of the disc. Disc area was defined by using the freehand region of interest measurement tool and tracing around the disc starting along the anterior longitudinal ligament, moving along the superior disc-vertebral interface, posterior longitudinal ligament and finally inferior disc-vertebral interface. Raw disc height was measured by dividing the disc area by length of horizontal line between anterior and posterior boundaries of intervertebral disc. The *elliptical region* represents the cerebrospinal fluid reference sample\n\nWe also investigated 3 different measures of disc signal intensity. These included (1) a raw disc signal intensity measure (2) a ratio adjusted for brightness of CSF (Batti\u00e9 et al. [@CR1]; Videman et al. [@CR14]) at the same level (ratio 1) and (3) a ratio adjusted for brightest level of CSF at any of the 5 spinal levels (ratio 2). Raw signal intensity was recorded for each disc area as defined above for measurement of disc height. All measurements of signal intensity were made using primary DICOM data, preserving the full dynamic range of the raw data. Ratio 1 was calculated by dividing the raw disc signal intensity for each vertebral level by the signal intensity of the CSF at the adjacent level. Ratio 2 was calculated by dividing the raw disc signal intensity by the signal intensity of the most intense CSF at any of the 5 spinal levels. A clean sample of CSF adjacent to vertebra levels was used as the intra-body reference standard, accept at stenotic levels where it was difficult to obtain a clean sample so the level of the vertebral body above was used.\n\nAnalysis {#Sec7}\n--------\n\nTo investigate the inter-tester reliability of the quantitative measures of disc height and signal intensity we used intra class correlation coefficient (ICC) comparing scores from both assessors across the 380 disc levels.\n\nTo investigate the relationship between Pfirrmann scores and each of the quantitative measures of disc height and signal intensity we calculated the mean and SD of each quantitative measure for each Pfirrmann score (1--5), across all 380 discs. We also plotted these to help visual inspection of the relationship. All quantitative measures were based on average scores from the 2 assessors. To statistically test the relationship between Pfirrmann scores and quantitative measures we used one way ANOVA, with (Pfirrmann score as independent variable) and quantitative MRI score as dependent variable. The dependent variable was tested to ensure normality. If the ANOVA was significant we then performed post hoc testing with Tukey's test, to test paired comparisons between each level of Pfirrmann scores (e.g. 4 vs 5).\n\nTo assess the strength of the relationship between Pfirrmann scores and each of the quantitative measures we planned to perform linear regression to determine the explained variance (R^2^), if the visual inspection of the association when plotted suggested a linear relationship.\n\nSPSS software 21 was used for statistical analysis and the level of significance was set at p\u00a0\\<\u00a00.05.\n\nResults {#Sec8}\n=======\n\nBetween September 2012 and April 2013, 76 people were enrolled in the study. The characteristics of included participants are presented in Table\u00a0[2](#Tab2){ref-type=\"table\"}. Participants mean age was 45 and all were recently free from low back pain, having recovered from an episode of low back pain within the previous 3\u00a0months.Table\u00a02Baseline characteristicsParticipant s (N\u00a0=\u00a076)Male gender, n (%)46 (60.5)Age, mean (SD)45 (13)Height (cm), mean (SD)171.38 (9.6)Weight (kg), mean (SD)79.63 (18.78)BMI, mean (SD)26.9 (5.1)Previous episodes of low back pain median, (IQR)2.5 (1--7.8)\n\nReliability of quantitative measures {#Sec9}\n------------------------------------\n\nThe reliability values were excellent for both disc height and signal intensity measures, regardless of whether the raw scores were used or either of the 2 ratios. ICC ranged from 0.97 (95\u00a0% CI 0.96--0.97) to 0.98 (95\u00a0% CI 0.97--0.98) for signal intensity and 0.96 (95\u00a0% CI 0.953--0.9769) to 0.97 (95\u00a0% CI 0.95--0.97) for disc height.\n\nRelationship between quantitative measures of disc height and Pfirrmann score {#Sec10}\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe relationship between the 3 quantitative measures of disc height (raw score, ratio 1 and ratio 2) can be seen in Table\u00a0[3](#Tab3){ref-type=\"table\"} and Fig.\u00a0[2](#Fig2){ref-type=\"fig\"}. The ANOVA suggests that there is a relationship (p\u00a0\\<\u00a00.001); however, the relationship is clearly not linear. There is no relationship between quantitative disc height measures and Pfirrmann scores from grades 1 to 4 (Table\u00a0[3](#Tab3){ref-type=\"table\"}; Fig.\u00a0[2](#Fig2){ref-type=\"fig\"}); however, disc levels with Pfirrmann score of grade 5 have significantly lower quantitative disc height scores than discs with grades 1--4 Pfirrmann scores. These findings were consistent regardless of whether we used raw disc height scores or ratio 1 or 2. Due to the non-linear relationship we did not explore the explained variance (R^2^) using linear regression.Table\u00a03Relationship between quantitative disc height and signal intensity with Pfirrmann's scorePfirrmann 1\\\nN\u00a0=\u00a024Pfirrmann 2\\\nN\u00a0=\u00a0165Pfirrmann 3\\\nN\u00a0=\u00a096Pfirrmann 4\\\nN\u00a0=\u00a082Pfirrmann 5\\\nN\u00a0=\u00a013p value\\\nSignificant pairwise comparisons (p\u00a0\\<\u00a00.01)DH_Raw (cm)0.80 (0.14)0.77 (0.14)0.81 (0.16)0.75 (0.15)0.46 (0.10)Pfirrmann 5 compared to all other Pfirrmann levelsDH ratio 10.0046 (0.0007)0.0045 (0.0008)0.0047 (0.0009)0.0044 (0.0009)0.0027 (0.0005)Pfirrmann 5 compared to all other Pfirrmann levelsDH ratio 20.29 (0.05)0.28 (0.05)0.30 (0.06)0.28 (0.06)0.17 (0.03)Pfirrmann 5 compared to all other Pfirrmann levelsSI-Raw245.7 (58.3)208.4 (52.7)138.55 (34.0)98.7 (22.7)76.2 (22.7)All comparisons except Pfirrmann 4 compared to 5SI-ratio10.30 (0.10)0.22 (0.06)0.14 (0.03)0.11 (0.02)0.08 (0.03)All comparisons except Pfirrmann 4 compared to 5SI_ratio20.25 (0.07)0.19 (0.05)0.13 (0.03)0.09 (0.03)0.07 (0.03)All comparisons except Pfirrmann 4 compared to 5All values are mean (SD).

The ANOVA suggests that there is a relationship (p\u00a0\\<\u00a00.001), which appears to be linear between quantitative signal intensity measures and Pfirrmann scores grade 1--4 (Table\u00a0[3](#Tab3){ref-type=\"table\"}; Fig.\u00a0[3](#Fig3){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Paired comparisons found no significant difference in signal intensity between discs with a Pfirrmann score of 5 compared to 4. These findings were consistent regardless of whether we used raw signal intensity scores or ratio 1 or 2. Due to the linear relationship we explored the explained variance (R^2^) using linear regression. R^2^ for raw signal intensity, ratio 1 and 2 was 0.57 (p\u00a0\\<\u00a00.001), 0.49 (p\u00a0\\<\u00a00.001) and 0.55 (p\u00a0\\<\u00a00.001) respectively.Fig.\u00a03Relationship between disc signal intensity with Pfirrmann scores. **a** Relationship between raw disc signal intensity and Pfirrman scores. **b** Relationship between disc signal intensity ratio 1 and Pfirrman scores. **c** Relationship between disc signal intensity ratio 2 and Pfirrman scores.

The signal intensity decreases with the increasing extent of disc degeneration according to Pfirrmann scores, except for between grade 4 and 5 where the decrease was not statistically significant. In contrast quantitative measures of disc height were only statistically reduced for the most degenerative discs (Pfirrmann grade 5). Whether we used raw or adjusted measures of disc signal intensity or disc height did not substantially change the relationship between disc height or signal intensity with Pfirrmann scores. The quantitative measures of disc signal intensity and height had excellent inter-tester reliability.\n\nStrengths and weaknesses {#Sec14}\n------------------------\n\nOur study has several strengths that increase the validity of the findings. We recruited a homogeneous sample of patients who had recently recovered from acute low back pain and followed a strict imaging protocol for all participants using a single high field strength system. Subjective and quantitative MRI measures were conducted according to strict criteria and there was no missing data. We investigated both a \"raw\" measure and 2 adjusted measures of both disc height and signal intensity enabling us to further explore the ability of different quantitative measures to compare between individuals. A weakness of our study is that we had a relatively small number of discs with a grade 5 Pfirrmann score so we have less power in comparing this group to the other Pfirrmann grades. We did not standardize the time of day at which imaging was performed and this may have a small impact on disc height or signal intensity. Also all quantitative measures were done by 2 master students with limited prior experience; however, the results demonstrated excellent reliability.\n\nAn alternative approach to measuring disc signal intensity, which was not used in the current study, is T2 relaxation time mapping (Watanabe et al. [@CR19]). This approach may be more accurate and does not require normalisation to CSF as performed in the current study; however, this approach requires a longer scanning time and a more complex and time consuming analysis making it less practical for routine clinical use.\n\nComparison to previous studies {#Sec15}\n------------------------------\n\nTo our knowledge this is the first study to compare different quantitative measures of both signal intensity and disc height with Pfirrmann scores. Niu et al. ([@CR9]) compared 2 quantitative MRI imaging tools (apparent coefficient diffusion and T2 signal intensity) with each other and Pfirrmann scores in people with low back pain and healthy subjects. They concluded T2 intensity is a sensitive method for detecting early stages of disc degeneration. This is consistent with our finding that signal intensity has a strong association with Pfirrmann grades 1--4. Luoma et al. ([@CR7]) quantitatively measured disc height (ant and post height) and signal intensity in 109 men working in 3 different occupational roles, using T2 weighted MRI. Similar to our findings they question the validity of disc height as an early measure of disc degeneration. Teichtahl et al. ([@CR12]) compared quantitative measures of disc height with Pfirrmann scores in 72 community based individuals. They found small reductions in disc height from grade 2 to grade 4 Pfirrmann scores and then a large reduction with grade 5 Pfirrmann scores. Jarman et aI. ([@CR6]) reported a disc height index was associated with Pfirrmann scores especially at the more severe levels of disc degeneration. These studies are somewhat different to our findings in that they did find an association between disc height and Pfirrmann scores even at lower grades; however, the differences were small and most obvious at Pfirrmann grade 5 as per our findings.\n\nSeveral studies have tested the reliability of quantitative measures of disc height and signal intensity (Fan et al. [@CR3]; Hon et al. [@CR5]; Pfirrmann et al. [@CR11]) and reported high reliability. Our study shows excellent inter-tester reliability can be achieved in raters who are not radiologists but undergo a training program and follow a strict protocol. This has important implications for future studies.\n\nMeaning of the study/implications {#Sec16}\n---------------------------------\n\nOur study suggests that quantitative measures of disc height and signal intensity must be used carefully to assess changes both within and between individuals with back pain. While the measures are reliable and sensitive to small changes our findings suggest signal intensity is likely to be sensitive to early to moderate disc degeneration, while disc height measures are only sensitive to end stage degeneration. The strong relationship between quantitative measures of disc signal intensity and Pfirrmann scores, suggests signal intensity could be used instead of Pfirrmann scores in studies where the increased sensitivity to change and reliability of the quantitative measures is important.\n\nAn interesting finding from our study was that the relationship between signal intensity and Pfirrmann's was similar regardless of whether we used raw values or ratios. This suggests that raw scores may be acceptable for comparing between individuals. In particular we note that the relationship between disc height and Pfirrmann scores was similar regardless of whether we used ratios that allowed for a person's height or not. Similarly the common practice of adjusting signal intensity by the CSF at a similar disc level did not influence the relationship with Pfirrmann scores. Earlier MRI imaging may have had greater spatially dependent inhomogeneity of signal intensity in the FOV than was present in our study. If however, significant spatially dependent inhomogeneity did exist it would seem logical that using some reference to allow for this would still be important to compare between discs and different scans. In our study we used a single 3T scanner and followed a strict protocol. Where this is not the case the use of CSF reference may be more important. We would expect the findings to be similar on a 1.5 T scanner, allowing for differences in spatial resolution and the intrinsic reduction in signal to noise ratio. Internal normalisation is an effective technique, independent of field strength.\n\nConclusions {#Sec17}\n===========\n\nQuantitative measures of disc signal intensity are strongly related to Pfirrmann scores from grade 1 to 4; however, quantitative measures of disc height only differentiate between grade 4 and 5 Pfirrmann scores. Using adjusted values for quantitative measures of disc height or signal intensity did not significantly alter the relationship with Pfirrmann scores; however, this may need to be investigated for multicenter or multi-scanner studies.\n\nAll authors contributed to the conception and design of the study, data collection and management, analysis and interpretation of the study.

{"text": "Frankenstein (Death Race)\n\nFrankenstein is a fictional character and the protagonist of the Death Race franchise. Within the film universe, the character is an alias taken on by other characters who participate in the titular race. The character has been played by David Carradine, Jason Statham, Luke Goss, Dougray Scott, Manu Bennett, and Velislav Pavlov.\n\nCharacter biography\n\nDeath Race 2000 (1975)\nIn the original 1975 film, Frankenstein is portrayed as the reigning champion of the Transcontinental Road Race, an annual gladiator-style cross-country race. A symbol of the ruling totalitarian government, he is a feared racer who is purported to be half-man, half-machine.\n\nIn reality, it turns out that there have been several Frankensteins over the years \u2013 each one recruited by the government to replace their injured or killed predecessors. In this way, with each man donning the same alias and disguise, Frankenstein seems to be an unkillable opponent who survives any crash or injury. The current Frankenstein (David Carradine), is disillusioned with the government, as well as the race, and he plans to assassinate the tyrannical President (Sandy McCallum). Although his plans to win the race and destroy the government are nearly ruined by the actions of a Resistance movement, he eventually succeeds in both winning the race and killing the President. He then assumes the office of President himself and puts an end to the race.\n\nDeath Race (2008)\nIn the 2008 remake of the 1975 film, ex-race driver Jensen Ames (Jason Statham) is imprisoned on Terminal Island after he is framed for his wife's murder. Terminal Island is home to a televised gladiator-style race called the Death Race, and Ames soon finds himself forced to race by the tyrannical Warden Hennessey (Joan Allen). Ames must assume the mantle of Frankenstein, the current leading racer, whose appearance is covered by a mask. The previous Frankenstein was killed in a fiery crash, though the prison population believes he has simply spent the last six months recovering in the infirmary. The previous Frankenstein had already won four out of five races necessary to secure freedom, requiring Ames to only win one more race. Hennessey explains that Frankenstein is the most popular racer in the history of the race, and ratings would take a sharp hit if his death were announced.\n\nAmes soon learns that Hennessey was behind his wife's murder, using Ulrich (Jason Clarke), the lead guard, and Pachenko (Max Ryan), a fellow racer. Ames decides to win the Death Race and use it as means of revenge. With only his pit crew knowing the truth about Frankenstein, Ames goes on to uncover what happened to his predecessor, kills Pachenko during the race, and ultimately succeeds in using the race to escape, along with his chief rival, Machine-Gun Joe (Tyrese Gibson). Afterwards, Coach (Ian McShane), a member of his pit crew, detonates a bomb in Hennessey's office, killing both her and Ulrich. It is unknown if the Frankenstein mantle was resurrected by the next warden.\n\nDeath Race 2 (2011)\nThe first prequel to the 2008 film reveals the origins of Frankenstein. Getaway driver Carl \"Luke\" Lucas (Luke Goss) is captured after a bank robbery gone bad, in which he was to protect the nephew of crime boss Markus Kane (Sean Bean). Although loyal and refusing to cooperate with the authorities, Lucas is marked for death by Kane because he knows too much. He is sent to Terminal Island and recruited to compete in the Death Match, a brutal gladiator-style show, ostensibly run by the aging warden but, in reality, controlled by producer September Jones (Lauren Cohan). His fight results in a large-scale prison riot and ultimately spells the end of the controversial show.\n\nThe Death Match is replaced by the Death Race, a gladiatorial race that uses custom cars and unused space along the island's outer edges. The prize for winning five races is freedom. Lucas initially does well, but is targeted by the other drivers due to the bounty on his head. When he saves the life of fellow driver 14K (Robin Shou), 14K pays back this favor by killing Kane. Ultimately, Lucas is driven off the track and ends up in a seemingly fatal crash. However, he returns under a new identity created by Jones, Frankenstein, a horribly scarred racer who wears a mask. However, at the start of his next race, he rams and kills Jones, to the pleasure of her many enemies.\n\nDeath Race 3: Inferno (2013)\nIn the second prequel, a direct bridge to the 2008 film, Lucas' (Luke Goss) appearance is restored with reconstructive surgery, but he still does not reveal his identity to his pit crew.  However, they discover that Lucas is Frankenstein after his mask is knocked off during a brawl at Kalahari Prison in South Africa, where Lucas and his crew are sent to compete in the first International Death Race. The new race is the brainchild of British billionaire Niles York (Dougray Scott). Because Lucas has won four of the five races required for his freedom, York demands that he throw the final race or face death.\n\nAt the end of the race, Lucas crashes his car into the operations center, where York has been handcuffed to a table by his producer, incensed by York firing and replacing her. York is horribly burned in the fiery crash, and the world at large is then led to believe that York is the survived Frankenstein, despite his protestations. Lucas and his crew stage their deaths and escape, while the disfigured York, resigned to the fact that everyone believes that he is Frankenstein, adopts the mantle. The film ends with York, now using an American accent (strongly implying that it is he who is the Frankenstein killed at the start of the 2008 film), stating in voiceover, \"I am Frankenstein. And I will have my revenge.\"\n\nDeath Race: Beyond Anarchy (2018)\nIn the first sequel of the remake series, a new Frankenstein (played by Bulgarian actor Velislav Pavlov and voiced by Nolan North) has become the ruler of a prison colony called the Sprawl and has won seven races, despite the race now being illegal. Weyland International had tried to have Frankenstein killed several times, all without success. \n\nFrankenstein takes an interest in newly-arrived prisoner Connor (Zach McGowan) when the man not only beats up several of Frankenstein's henchmen, but also shows no fear or respect towards him when he confronted him personally. After observing Connor win a qualifying match in the Death Pit by gruesomely defeating his henchman the Butcher, Frankenstein has Connor brought to him and tells him that if he wins the Death Race, he will become king of the Sprawl, and asks if he is ready for that responsibility.\n\nThe next day, Frankenstein discovers that Connor is actually Sergeant Connor Gibson, a soldier sent by Weyland International with the purpose of killing him. He outs Connor in front of the prison populace and declares that Connor will be allowed to take part in the Death Race, earning Connor much hate from the populace. \n\nAt the starting line of the Death Race, Frankenstein reveals to Connor that he has made Jane (Christine Marzano), the prison bartender who has become Connor's love interest, his new co-pilot as an \"insurance policy\" against Connor. Throughout the Death Race, competitors are taken out one by one until at the final stretch, when Connor finally catches up to Frankenstein that Connor runs out of gas. Despite pleading from Jane, Frankenstein choses to run Connor down with his car when he is suddenly t-boned by the other remaining runner-up, Gypsy Rose (Yennis Cheung), who shoots him dead, revealing herself to also be a soldier sent by Weyland International.\n\nIn the aftermath, Connor is convinced by Sprawl resident Baltimore Bob (Danny Glover) to take up the mantle and become the new Frankenstein, to which he does.\n\nPortrayals\nIn each film, Frankenstein is played by one or more characters and, thus, actors.\n In the original film version, Death Race 2000, Frankenstein was portrayed by David Carradine.\n In the opening scene of the first film of the remake series, Death Race, Frankenstein is played by an unknown character/actor and voiced by David Carradine, in a nod to the original 1975 film. For the rest of the film, the role is taken up by Jason Statham's character, Jensen Garner Ames.\n In the first prequel of the remake series, Death Race 2, the Frankenstein persona is introduced near the end of the film, and is named Carl \"Luke\" Lucas (Luke Goss).\n At the end of the second prequel of the remake series, Death Race 3: Inferno, billionaire Niles York is forced to assume the Frankenstein mantle, and is portrayed by Dougray Scott.\nIn the sequel to the original film version, Death Race 2050, Frankenstein is portrayed by Manu Bennett.\nIn the first sequel of the remake series, Death Race: Beyond Anarchy, the mantle of Frankenstein is taken up by an otherwise unnamed character, played by Bulgarian actor Velislav Pavlov and voiced by Nolan North. The new Frankenstein is an antagonist, instead of a protagonist. At the end of the film, Sergeant Connor Gibson, a soldier sent by Weyland International and is portrayed by Zach McGowan, takes his mantle and becomes the new Frankenstein.\n\nAppearances\n\nFilms\n\nOriginal films\n Death Race 2000 (1975), directed by Paul Bartel\n Death Race 2050 (2017), directed by G.

{"text": "Q:\n\nIs it normal to be stopped from doing experiments for months due to \"equipment malfunctioning\" during masters?\n\nI am currently doing a medical science research masters with a difficult supervisor. Due to two incidents of equipment malfunctions (equipment that I am using), I was stopped from doing any experiments for more than three months in total. During the three months I did almost nothing. Over the entire 6 months that I have been here, I have only had one month during which I was able to generate any sufficient results (the other months I was learning the technique).  My supervisor rejected my proposal to switch to a new technique or use a different equipment set-up. What worries me is that I won't be able to gather sufficient results to write my thesis by July (which is the deadline), and I haven't even started my masters project.\nI am wondering whether anybody else has similarly experienced this situation before and whether this is normal during your PhD i.e. doing absolutely nothing for 3 months or more due to the excuse of \"equipment faults\"? Do you just switch to a different experiment or part of the project which utilize different techniques? Could somebody please help me understand why my supervisor is doing this - is this normal for labs which lack funding? \nWhat should I do? Should I make a formal complaint to the university about my masters supervisor? If I do so, I am afraid that the animosity between me and my supervisor will be beyond repair and he will not support me at all in finishing in time for the deadline. If it keeps on like this, I won't get enough results to sufficiently write the project thesis. \n\nA:\n\nIn experimental sciences, such incidents are unfortunately common.  I do a lot of work in synthetic biology, for example, and it's not unusual to have a lab run into serious equipment or materials problems that significantly delay the work of the lab.  For example, one lab I was working with had a critical machine start producing strange results and it took a couple of months, several corrupted experiments, more than one technician visit, and also a change of protocols in order to debug it.\nIf the lab you are in is actively working to fix the equipment issues, and it is just taking a long time, that would not be unusual.  If they are not but are just neglecting it, then that is a very bad sign and you need to talk to the people who run your program to find out what to do.\nIn either case, you should make arrangements, either with your advisor or with the program heads, about how to adjust expectations given the equipment problems. Equipment issues should not be your problem or delay your graduation at a Masters level (Ph.D. is a different matter).\n\n", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "StackExchange"}}

{"text": "Minnesota charities scrambling to recover millions of dollars invested with businessman Tom Petters violated a basic duty to be prudent with donated money, according to experts in nonprofit finance.\n\nFor at least five years, religious nonprofits, led by Fidelis Foundation, based in Plymouth, made large, unconventional loans to businessman Tom Petters' company -- supposedly secured by merchandise -- in return for interest payouts of 19 to 22 percent.\n\nSix charities had more than $27 million invested with Petters when federal authorities alleged last month that he and others had run a massive Ponzi scheme that bilked investors out of more than $3 billion.\n\nPetters, an entrepreneur with major holdings in Sun Country Airlines, Polaroid and other companies, is now jailed on federal fraud and money-laundering charges. He maintains he is innocent, though four others implicated in the alleged scheme have pleaded guilty to related charges.\n\nAs the criminal case developed, several of Petters' companies were put into receivership and 10 filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.\n\nPrivate investors lent far more to Petters' companies than did charities. But experts in nonprofit management say that charity boards of directors have special responsibilities to be financially prudent with donated, tax-exempt money.\n\nAnd they say the charities dropped the ball for years by making the Petters' investments.\n\nAccording to financial statements and charity officials, Fidelis Foundation invested most of its assets in Petters' companies, more than doubling its exposure over the past five years. It also made investments in Petters' company for six other charities, including Minnesota Teen Challenge, a drug treatment program, and Mars Hill Media, which produces faith-based advertising, Christian books and recordings.\n\nSteve Klingaman, a Minneapolis nonprofit consultant and author of an upcoming book on running them, said it is highly unusual for a nonprofit to concentrate its investments in such high-interest loans. Most charities park money in conventional, secure investments offering modest returns, he said.\n\n\"Frankly, it doesn't even pass the smell test -- you look at it and how could they possibly make those kinds of returns?\" Klingaman added.\n\nThat view is shared by Kate Barr, executive director of the Nonprofits Assistance Fund, which advises charities on management and finance. She said the charities' investments in Petters Co. Inc., a financing vehicle, and other Petters entities constitute a case study in how not to run a nonprofit.\n\n\"If you are going to ... put all your eggs in one basket and it is a basket that has no liquidity and no market value, how could that possibly be a prudent investment?\" Barr said.\n\nJoseph Smith, president of Fidelis Foundation, said the nonprofit has retained a lawyer to attempt to recover the money. Mars Hill already has filed a lawsuit seeking to recover its $800,000 investment.\n\nOver the years, the Petters investments generated millions of dollars of income that helped ministries, Smith said. Merchandise-backed loans to Petters \"seemed to be a logical transaction\" and everyone assumed the products existed, he added.\n\n\"I recognize it has been devastating to the ministries -- it has been harmful to us, there is no doubt about it. We're all saddened by this, but it wasn't like it has always been that way,\" he added.\n\nHe and Fidelis board chairman Craig Howse declined to answer questions about how the board got involved in the Petters investments.\n\nOne of Fidelis' major supporters is Frank Vennes Jr. of Shorewood. He became a millionaire philanthropist by brokering investment deals for Petters' businesses, according to court papers. Vennes has not been charged in the fraud, but is identified in court papers as being part of it. He has 1987 convictions for money laundering and other crimes, and has said he underwent a religious conversion in prison.\n\nAlthough Fidelis, like most charities, doesn't identify its donors, Vennes is known to have been a major contributor to the foundation and other religious charities.\n\nRep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., last year cited his philanthropy, including his backing of Fidelis Foundation, in a letter supporting a presidential pardon for him. She withdrew the letter after the federal fraud case was disclosed, saying she \"may have too hastily accepted his claims of redemption.\"\n\nVennes is listed in corporation records of a company that donated a St. Louis County property to Fidelis. And he was part of a group that purchased a building from the Minneapolis schools in 2006 and donated it to Fidelis for use by Hope Academy, an inner-city school, and other nonprofits, according to Russ Gregg, the school's executive director.\n\nVennes' other connection to Fidelis is through his lawyer, Howse, who is the foundation's board chairman and a member of its finance committee. Howse cited attorney-client privilege as the reason he couldn't answer questions about Vennes, his contributions to Fidelis, or Howse's role in the foundation's investments with Petters. Vennes also declined to comment.\n\nVennes has told his friends in the Christian community that he is innocent of wrongdoing. Smith, the president of Fidelis, said he believes Vennes is a victim of the Petters fraud. Vennes' companies are listed as major creditors in the Petters' bankruptcy cases.\n\nBrian Gudmundson, a Minneapolis attorney who represents a group of ministers and nonprofits suing to recoup their investments with Petters, said: \"For now they are giving Frank [Vennes] the benefit of the doubt.\"\n\nJon Pratt, executive director of the Minnesota Council of Nonprofits, said relationships between donors and nonprofit officials generally have raised concerns with the IRS, which is changing disclosure requirements on tax forms.\n\nHe said he didn't have enough facts to comment on whether the Vennes-Fidelis-Howse connections are a conflict of interest. But he added: \"It makes you want to know more.\"\n\nPoor seamanship and flaws in keeping watch contributed to a collision between a Navy destroyer and a commercial container ship that killed seven sailors, Navy officials said, announcing that the warship captain will be relieved of command and more than a dozen other sailors will be punished.\n\nGunnar Birkerts, an internationally acclaimed modernist architect who designed buildings including the Federal Reserve Bank in Minneapolis, the Corning Museum of Glass in Corning, New York, and the University of Michigan Law Library, has died. He was 92.\n\nOn the floor of the Honda Center, the USA Gymnastics championships are imbued with a sense of normalcy and routine. Of tumbling runs and coaching tweaks.

{"text": "INTRODUCTION\n============\n\nCellular senescence is a cell cycle arrest program induced by various stresses that renders cells insensitive to mitogenic signals and impairs the proliferation and expansion of damaged cells ([@R1]). Activation of oncogenes such as *RAS* in somatic cells induces a senescence program termed oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) ([@R2]). OIS is a cell-intrinsic tumor suppressor mechanism that impairs tumor progression ([@R2]--[@R7]). Senescence is also characterized by the activation of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). The SASP is a cocktail of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and matrix-remodeling proteins with diverse functions and roles ([@R8]--[@R10]). Through the SASP, senescent cells elicit multiple paracrine effects to promote the normal processes associated with inflammation, wound healing, tissue remodeling, and cell plasticity ([@R11]--[@R14]) or it can disrupt tissue homeostasis, promoting aging and other pathophysiological conditions such as fibrosis and cancer ([@R12]). The SASP reinforces the cell cycle arrest by activating p53 and the cell cycle inhibitors p21^CIP1^ and p15^INK4b^ ([@R8], [@R10], [@R15]). The SASP also promotes paracrine senescence ([@R15]) and stimulates immune surveillance that results in clearance of the senescent cells ([@R16]--[@R18]), which collectively contribute to the tumor suppressor program elicited by OIS. Therefore, the immune system can regulate senescence and determine senescent cell fate ([@R19]--[@R21]).\n\nThe activation of the SASP is primarily regulated by the transcription factors nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein \u03b2 (C/EBP\u03b2) ([@R8], [@R10], [@R22]). SASP activation responds to a hierarchical model where interleukin-1\u03b1 (IL-1\u03b1) and IL-1\u03b2 are the apical cytokines signaling through IL-1 receptor (IL-1R), triggering a cascade of additional amplifying feedback loops by other cytokines and chemokines of the SASP. As a consequence, NF-\u03baB and C/EBP\u03b2 activation are sustained, and the expression of the SASP is maintained. Interfering with these feedback loops, such as the one set up by IL-1, IL-6, or IL-8, collapses the network, impairing the induction of the SASP and the activation of the cell cycle arrest ([@R8], [@R10], [@R15], [@R23]).\n\nWe have previously shown that the inflammasome regulates the activation of the SASP ([@R15]). The inflammasome is a multiprotein platform that induces the proteolytic activity of the inflammatory cysteine-aspartic protease Caspase-1. It is a key regulatory component of the innate immune response and the first line of defense against pathogens and damage ([@R24]). Activation of the inflammasome leads to cleavage and activation of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1\u03b2. Inflammasomes are controlled by a family of receptors called pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). PRRs are receptors of the innate immune system that are activated by interaction with pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or with damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that are generated endogenously in cells under certain conditions of stress and damage ([@R25]). There are three major PRR families: Toll-like receptors (TLRs), RIG-I--like receptors, and NOD-like receptors ([@R25]). Upon activation, PRRs induce distinct signal transduction pathways that activate an immune transcriptional program mostly regulated by NF-\u03baB and interferon regulatory factors (IRFs).\n\nAlthough the steady-state signaling of the SASP is relatively well understood, the molecular mechanism(s) that initiates the SASP in OIS and how the inflammasome is primed during OIS remain ill defined. Here, we describe the mechanism that underlies the priming of the inflammasome in OIS by PRRs, identifying the senescence-associated DAMP that initiates the SASP and reinforces OIS.\n\nRESULTS\n=======\n\nThe innate immune receptor TLR2 is induced during cellular senescence\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo study OIS, we used the well-characterized IMR90 human diploid fibroblast cell line transduced with an Estrogen Receptor:H-RAS^G12V^ fusion protein (henceforth referred to as ER:RAS). ER:RAS oncogenic activity is induced after addition of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4OHT) to the cultures, resulting in a time-controlled OIS response as previously described ([@R15]) ([Fig. 1A](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of the transcriptome of IMR90 ER:RAS senescent cells showed an enrichment for \"innate immunity,\" \"PRR,\" and \"TLR\" terms (fig. S1A). Therefore, we decided to explore the role of TLRs in OIS. Analysis of the gene expression of all 10 human TLR genes showed a marked induction of *TLR2* expression in OIS ([Fig. 1B](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"} and fig. S1, B and C). The induction of *TLR2* mRNA correlated with an increase in TLR2 protein ([Fig. 1C](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}), which corresponded with the cell cycle arrest during OIS ([Fig. 1C](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}). The induction of *TLR2* was also observed after additional OIS by retroviral transduction of oncogenic H-Ras^G12V^, by the activation of senescence with a DNA damage-inducing agent (etoposide), and by conditioned medium from OIS cells (paracrine senescence) (fig. S1, B to E) ([@R15]). However, the induction of senescence with nongenotoxic agents such as the cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) inhibitor palbociclib or the mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2) inhibitor Nutlin 3a failed to induce *TLR2* and the SASP (fig. S1, B and C), suggesting that the activation of TLR2 expression is associated to genotoxic stress.\n\n![TLR2 expression is induced during OIS.\\\n(**A**) Schematic showing IMR90 ER:RAS cells treated with 4OHT undergo OIS.

Scale bars, 50 \u03bcm.](aaw0254-F1){#F1}\n\nIn vivo, we analyzed *tlr2* expression in four well-characterized mouse models of senescence. We first examined the expression of *tlr2* in a murine model of OIS, in which conditional expression of Kras^G12D^ by Pdx-CRE (KC mouse) induces pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) ([@R26]). A marked induction of Tlr2 was observed in ductal pancreatic cells in PanINs with low Ki67 indexes, indicating that Tlr2 is expressed in early senescent PanINs (fig. S2A). We then investigated an additional model where OIS is induced in murine hepatocytes via hydrodynamic delivery of a mutant Nras^G12V^ encoding transposon along with a sleeping beauty transposase--expressing plasmid ([@R16]). A plasmid encoding an Nras^G12V^ effector loop mutant, incapable of downstream Nras signaling (Nras^G12V/D38A^), was used as a negative control. Six days after Nras^G12V^ transduction, *tlr2* mRNA expression was significantly increased in comparison to controls ([Fig. 1D](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}), which correlated with the expected induction of mRNA expression of the senescence markers *dcr2* and *arf* and the SASP factor IL-1\u03b2 (fig. S2B). To investigate whether *tlr2* induction in this model derives from Nras-expressing hepatocytes or recruited immune cells, we performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) for Nras and Tlr2 protein expressions in consecutive liver sections. Analysis of these sections revealed that the expression of Tlr2 was induced in hepatocytes of mice transduced with active Nras and was not present in the inactive control ([Fig. 1E](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Moreover, superposition of consecutive sections stained for Nras and Tlr2 showed an overlap between both signals, suggesting that the hepatocytes expressing active Nras^G12V^ are indeed the cells overexpressing Tlr2 ([Fig. 1E](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"} and fig. S2C). We then investigated the expression of *tlr2* in a model of inflammatory-mediated senescence, where knockout of *nfkb1* (*nfkb1^\u2212/\u2212^)* in mice leads to constitutive activation of NF-\u03baB ([@R27]). An increased number of airway epithelial cells expressing Tlr2 were detected, which correlated with p21^Cip1^ expression in the lung airways (fig. S2D). Last, we observed an increase in the number of cells positively expressing Tlr2 in alveolar cells of the lung in aged mice (fig. S2E). These results indicate that TLR2 is induced in cellular senescence.\n\nTLR2 controls the activation of the SASP in OIS\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nWe previously identified that activation of IL-1R signaling by the inflammasome was essential for the induction of the SASP ([@R15]). However, before inflammasome activation, the expression of IL-1\u03b2 should be primed ([@R28], [@R29]). TLR2 forms functional heterodimers with three other TLRs: TLR1, TLR6, and TLR10 ([@R30]--[@R32]). To evaluate the activity of all four members of the TLR2 network in IL-1\u03b2 priming, we knocked down their expression during OIS using four pooled small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) (fig. S3A). While knockdown of TLR1 and TLR6 marginally decreased the expression of IL-1\u03b2, TLR2 and TLR10 knockdown strongly decreased its induction ([Fig. 2, A to C](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}, and fig. S3B), suggesting a predominant role for these receptors in priming the inflammasome in OIS. To rule out off-target effects from the siRNAs, we tested all four individual siRNAs from the TLR2 and TLR10 pool. Each siRNA produced efficient TLR2 knockdown in IMR90 ER:RAS cells (fig. S3C) and decreased the expression of IL-1\u03b2 in OIS (fig. S3D). Similarly, two single siRNAs from the pooled siRNA also efficiently reduced the expression of TLR10 and impaired IL-1\u03b2 transcriptional activation (fig. S3, C and E). TLR2 and TLR10 knockdown resulted in reduced production of mature active IL-1\u03b2 ([Fig. 2B](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}) and a decrease in the accumulation of mature IL-1\u03b2 in conditioned media of IMR90 ER:RAS cells (fig. S3B), indicating a crucial role for the TLR2 network for the inflammasome function in senescence. Inflammasome activation is a key step in the induction of the SASP during OIS ([@R15]). Therefore, we studied the effect of TLR2 signaling in SASP induction. Targeting TLR2 and TLR10 with siRNA impaired the induction of mRNA expression of the SASP components IL-1\u03b1, IL-6, IL-8, CCL20, matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1), MMP3, and inhibin beta A (INHBA) ([Fig. 2C](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}) and blocked the induction of IL-8 and IL-6 proteins ([Fig. 2B](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"} and fig. S3F). Moreover, inhibition of TLR2 with oxidized-1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine (OxPAPC) significantly reduced IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 mRNA induction in OIS (fig. S3G). Last, knockdown of TLR2 and TLR10 in IMR90 cells impaired the induction of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-8 when exposed to conditioned media from senescent IMR90 ER:RAS cells, indicating a contribution of TLR2 in the propagation of the SASP during paracrine senescence (fig. S3H).\n\n![TLR2 and TLR10 regulate the SASP in OIS.\\\n(**A**) Immunofluorescence staining and high-content analysis for IL-1\u03b2 expression in IMR90 ER:RAS cells treated with 4OHT for 8 days and repeatedly transfected with pooled siRNA targeting TLR1, TLR2, TLR6, and TLR10.

S3I). We found that TLR2 knockdown significantly regulated more than 1000 genes, while TLR10 knockdown regulated up to 2500 genes (fig. S3I and data file S1). From the total number of genes positively regulated by TLR2 and TLR10 in OIS, 267 were common targets, indicating a high degree of overlap between genes positively regulated by TLR2 and TLR10 ([Fig. 2D](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"} and data file S2). The vast majority of genes regulated by TLR10 in OIS (956) were also not controlled by TLR2 in these experimental conditions ([Fig. 2D](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"} and data file S3). Gene ontology analysis of these genes indicated a significant enrichment in \"nucleotide binding proteins\"--related terms (fig. S3J). In contrast, gene ontology analysis of the genes commonly regulated by TLR2 and TLR10 in OIS showed enrichment for terms related to \"inflammatory response,\" \"chemotaxis,\" \"chemokine activity,\" and \"extracellular space\" ([Fig. 2E](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Moreover, the analysis revealed that TLR2 and TLR10 regulated the expression of most of the proinflammatory SASP, most notably chemokines, cytokines, and metalloproteases ([Fig. 2F](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}). TLR2 signals through NF-\u03baB and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) ([@R33]), which are key SASP regulators. A significant enrichment in genes regulated by NF-\u03baB in OIS ([@R22]) was observed in the transcriptome of control cells compared to TLR2-depleted cells ([Fig. 2G](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}), indicating an essential role for TLR2 signaling in NF-\u03baB activation in senescence. To confirm this, we targeted TLR2 and TLR10 with siRNA in 4OHT-treated IMR90 ER:RAS cells and showed a decrease in NF-\u03baB pathway activation \\[reduced inhibitor of nuclear factor \u03baB kinase \u03b1/\u03b2 (IKK\u03b1/\u03b2) and p65 phosphorylation\\] ([Fig. 2, H and I](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}). We also observed a marked decrease in p38 MAPK phosphorylation in TLR2- and TLR10-depleted cells in OIS ([Fig. 2H](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}). These results show that TLR2 signaling is a significant contributor to the activation of the SASP by controlling NF-\u03baB and p38 MAPK signal transduction pathways. Together, these data indicate that TLR2 signaling is necessary for the induction of the SASP.\n\nTLR2 reinforces the cell cycle arrest program in OIS\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nActivation of the SASP reinforces the cell cycle arrest program in senescence ([@R8], [@R10]). Moreover, p38 MAPK is a significant regulator of OIS, controlling the activation of p53 and p16^INK4a^ tumor suppressor genes ([@R34]). Inhibition of p38 MAPK, but not of NF-\u03baB, with chemical compounds bypassed the proliferative arrest and impaired p21^CIP1^ activation in IMR90 ER:RAS cells, showing a role for p38 MAPK in the reinforcement of the cell cycle arrest in OIS (fig. S4, A and B). Given the integral role TLR2 plays in the regulation of the SASP and p38 MAPK, we explored whether TLR2 also controls the cell cycle arrest in OIS. Overexpression of TLR2 induced cell cycle arrest and an increase in the number of senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase (SA-\u03b2-Gal)--positive cells ([Fig. 3, A and B](#F3){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Analysis of proliferation after ER:RAS activation showed that targeting TLR2 and TLR10 with siRNA strongly reduced the cell cycle arrest associated with OIS ([Fig. 3C](#F3){ref-type=\"fig\"}) and increased the long-term growth of ER:RAS cells ([Fig. 3D](#F3){ref-type=\"fig\"} and fig. S4, C and D). This effect correlated with a decrease in the number of cells positive for SA-\u03b2-Gal activity 10 days after ER:RAS activation ([Fig. 3E](#F3){ref-type=\"fig\"}). The control of proliferation by TLRs was specific for TLR2 and TLR10, as knockdown of the other eight members of the human TLR family did not show bypass of the cell cycle arrest program (fig. S4E). Suppression of TLR2 and TLR10 resulted in a decrease in p21^CIP1^, p16^INK4a^, and p15^INK4b^ mRNA expression ([Fig. 3F](#F3){ref-type=\"fig\"}) and a reduction of p53 protein levels ([Fig. 3G](#F3){ref-type=\"fig\"}). In addition, TLR10 knockdown induced escape of cell cycle arrest in cells subjected to conditioned media from OIS cells, suggesting a role in cell cycle arrest during paracrine senescence (fig. S4F). Together, these results indicate that TLR2 contributes to the cell cycle arrest program induced during OIS.\n\n![TLR2 reinforces the cell cycle arrest in OIS.\\\n(**A**) IMR90 cells infected with TLR2 or H-Ras^G12V^ expression vectors or empty vector (EV) control were seeded at low density and stained with crystal violet after 2 weeks.

S5A). The acute-phase response is a clinical indication of an inflammatory event such as infection, trauma, or neoplasia and is characterized by the production and secretion of acute-phase proteins, including C-reactive protein and acute-phase serum amyloids by the liver ([@R35]). The two genes most strongly down-regulated by TLR2 and TLR10 knockdown were acute-phase serum amyloids A1 and A2 (*SAA1* and *SAA2*; A-SAAs hereinafter) ([Fig. 4A](#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Other genes annotated as acute-phase response, such as *IL-1*\u03b1, *IL-1*\u03b2, *IL-6*, *SERPINA3*, *ASS1*, and *PTGS2*, also showed strong regulation by TLR2 and TLR10 in OIS ([Fig. 4A](#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Further mRNA analysis by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) of SAA1, SAA2, SERPINA3, PTGS2, STAT3, and IL-6R expression confirmed these results ([Fig. 4B](#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}), indicating that the expression of A-SAAs is highly induced during OIS and is dependent on TLR2 and TLR10. A time-course analysis of OIS revealed that A-SAA expression is induced 5 days after the activation of oncogenic RAS with 4OHT, which overlaps with TLR2 induction ([Figs. 1C](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"} and [4C](#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}, and fig. S5B). Treatment of IMR90 cells with Pam2CSK4 (a synthetic agonist for TLR2) induced A-SAA expression, which was increased by one order of magnitude by ectopic overexpression of TLR2 (fig. S5C), suggesting a role for TLR2 sensing in the induction of A-SAAs in OIS. Western blot of the conditioned medium from IMR90 ER:RAS cells showed an accumulation of A-SAAs, which was reduced following siRNA knockdown of SAA1 and SAA2 ([Fig. 4D](#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"} and fig. S5D), suggesting that A-SAAs are components of the SASP. Similar to TLR2, A-SAA induction was associated to genotoxic stress. While induction of senescence with a genotoxic agent such as etoposide induced the expression of A-SAAs, direct induction of p53 activity with Nutlin 3a or by CDK4 inhibition with palbociclib failed to activate A-SAA expression (fig. S5E). We then studied the induction of A-SAAs in senescence in vivo. mRNA expression of *saa2* was induced in the lung of *nfkb1* knockout mice in parallel with the senescence markers cdkn1a (p21) and cdkn2a (p16) (fig. S5F). Moreover, increased expression of Saa1 was detected in early, low-proliferative PanINs in the KC mouse (fig. S5G). In summary, these results show that A-SAAs are components of the SASP regulated by TLR2.\n\n![A-SAA signaling through TLR2 controls the SASP.\\\n(**A**) Heat map showing the relative fold change of acute-phase response transcripts of samples from the acute-phase response gene set from the mRNA transcriptomes.

Thus, we decided to explore the role of A-SAAs regulating the SASP in OIS. Recombinant A-SAA (rA-SAA) induced IL-1\u03b2 mRNA expression with a similar effect to that achieved with an equimolar dose of the synthetic TLR2 agonist Pam2CSK4 (fig. S6A). Also, TLR2 overexpression in IMR90 cells enhanced rA-SAA--dependent induction of the SASP (fig. S6, B and C). Interference of TLR2 function with neutralizing antibodies (fig. S6D) or with siRNA against TLR2 and TLR10 ([Fig. 4E](#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"} and fig. S6E) also inhibited the rA-SAA--mediated induction of SASP components and SAA2. These results suggest that A-SAAs directly activate TLR2, resulting in priming of the inflammasome and SASP induction. To further confirm this, we decided to target the expression of A-SAAs during OIS with siRNA, showing that the induction of IL-1\u03b2 and the SASP ([Fig. 4, F and G](#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}) and the accumulation of mature IL-1\u03b2 and IL-8 in conditioned media ([Fig. 4D](#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}) were impaired when A-SAA was targeted. Moreover, treatment of IMR90 ER:RAS cells transfected with SAA2 siRNAs with the TLR2 agonist Pam2CSK4 rescued the induction of the SASP ([Fig. 4H](#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}), confirming that TLR2 requires the presence of A-SAAs or additional exogenous DAMPs for the activation of the SASP. Together, these data indicate that A-SAAs are the DAMPs that signal through TLR2 to prime the inflammasome and regulate the SASP in OIS.\n\nTo assess the relative importance of TLR2- and A-SAA--mediated SASP regulation, we compared the effect of TLR2, TLR10, and SAA2 with other previously described regulators of the SASP, including the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway \\[ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM)\\], the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase - stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) cytosolic DNA sensing pathway, the master SASP regulator IL-1 (IL-1R), the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, and the essential SASP transcription factors NF-\u03baB (RELA) and C/EBP\u03b2 ([@R37]). Knockdown of the A-SAA--TLR2 pathway had a similarly negative effect on IL-1\u03b2 induction to that following knockdown of the other known SASP regulators (fig. S6, F and G). In addition, knocking down the other A-SAA Toll-like receptor TLR4 did not decrease IL-1\u03b2, suggesting a specific role for A-SAA--TLR2 signaling in OIS (fig. S6G).\n\nLast, we wanted to assess the existence of this regulatory pathway in additional cell types and senescence triggers. We first explored the expression of TLR2, SAA1, and SAA2 in available transcriptomic datasets of senescence ([Fig. 4H](#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}). This analysis revealed that the A-SAA--TLR2 pathway was induced in senescence activated by acute stresses, such as therapy-induced senescence in lymphoma cells ([@R38]), BRAF^V600E^-induced senescence in human melanocytes ([@R39]), stasis in primary human mammary epithelial cells ([@R40]), and DDR-induced senescence in human dermal fibroblasts (BJ) ([@R41]), while it was not induced in replicative senescence ([@R41]) and programmed developmental senescence in the murine mesonephros ([Fig. 4H](#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}) ([@R42]). Notably, the gene set composed of the 267 genes coregulated by TLR2 and TLR10 in OIS ([Fig. 2D](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}) was significantly enriched (*P* \\< 0.01) only in those transcriptomes with activation of A-SAA--TLR2 expression ([Fig. 4I](#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}), while this correlation was not found with the transcriptome of replicative and developmental senescence (fig. S5H), suggesting a role for the A-SAA and TLR2 pair in senescence induced by several acute stresses in distinct cell types. Together, these results indicate that A-SAAs and TLR2 establish a master innate immune pathway with a key role in the control of the transcriptome in senescence.\n\nThe cGAS-STING cytosolic DNA sensing pathway controls the induction of TLR2 and A-SAAs in OIS\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nExperiments targeting RELA and ATM revealed that the activation of TLR2 and A-SAAs is dependent on NF-\u03baB and the DDR in OIS ([Fig. 5A](#F5){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Recently, it has been shown that, in senescence, NF-\u03baB is activated by the cGAS-STING cytosolic DNA sensing pathway by the accumulation of cytoplasmic chromatin fragments released from the damaged nucleus in response to genotoxic stress ([@R43]). Thus, we speculated that this pathway could be responsible for the induction of TLR2 and A-SAAs in OIS. Inactivation of cGAS and STING with siRNA in OIS strongly impaired the transcriptional activation of TLR2, SAA1, and SAA2 mRNA expression ([Fig. 5B](#F5){ref-type=\"fig\"}), indicating a role for the DNA sensing pathway in the regulation of TLR2 and A-SAAs. Moreover, direct activation of cGAS-STING by transfecting double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) into IMR90 cells induced the formation of STING homodimers, which is a hallmark of its activation, and induced TLR2 expression, which was reduced by STING knockdown ([Fig. 5, C and D](#F5){ref-type=\"fig\"}). STING signals through the NF-\u03baB and the interferon response pathways to transcriptionally activate its target genes. To elucidate how the cGAS-STING pathway induces the expression of TLR2 and A-SAAs, we knocked down RELA and IRF3 in cells transfected with dsDNA, showing that the inactivation of the NF-\u03baB pathway with siRNA against RELA, but not IRF3, impaired TLR2 and A-SAA induction in IMR90 cells ([Fig. 5C](#F5){ref-type=\"fig\"} and fig. S6, I and J). Moreover, in contrast to RELA knockdown ([Fig. 5A](#F5){ref-type=\"fig\"}), IRF3 targeting did not impair TLR2 induction in OIS (fig. S6K), suggesting a specific role for the NF-\u03baB pathway downstream of STING in TLR2 induction in OIS. Last, knockdown of TLR2 and TLR10 did not reduce the formation of STING homodimers in OIS ([Fig. 5D](#F5){ref-type=\"fig\"}), suggesting that TLR2 signaling is the downstream of the cGAS-STING pathway. Together, these results indicate that A-SAAs and TLR2 are downstream of the cGAS-STING cytosolic DNA sensing pathway in OIS.\n\n![A-SAA and TLR2 expression is dependent on STING activation.\\\n(**A** and **B**) IMR90 ER:RAS cells were treated with 4OHT and repeatedly transfected with indicated pooled siRNA and nontarget siRNA as control for 8 days. *TLR2*, *SAA1*, and *SAA2* transcripts were measured by qRT-PCR.

S7A). Therefore, we decided to test the effect of knocking out *tlr2* (*tlr2^\u2212/\u2212^*) on SASP activation in KC mice. We observed a reduction in IL-1\u03b1 staining in PanIN epithelial cells of *tlr2^\u2212/\u2212^* mice compared to wild-type (WT) mice ([Fig. 6A](#F6){ref-type=\"fig\"}), indicating a causal role for TLR2 in the activation of the SASP in PanIN. We also assessed the effect on SASP expression after hydrodynamic delivery of Nras^G12V^ transposons into hepatocytes of *tlr2^\u2212/\u2212^* mice ([Fig. 6, B and C](#F6){ref-type=\"fig\"}). The transduction of oncogenic Nras^G12V^, but not of the inactive Nras^G12V/D38A^, induced IL-1\u03b2, IL-1\u03b1, and IL-6 mRNA expression ([Fig. 6B](#F6){ref-type=\"fig\"}) and the accumulation of IL-1\u03b2-- and Tlr2-positive hepatocytes ([Fig. 6C](#F6){ref-type=\"fig\"}) in WT mice. In contrast, Nras^G12V^ failed to induce IL-1\u03b2-- and Tlr2-positive hepatocytes and IL-1\u03b2 mRNA expression in the liver of *tlr2^\u2212/\u2212^* mice ([Fig. 6, B and C](#F6){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Moreover, the induction of other SASP components, IL-1\u03b1 and IL-6, was also impaired in *tlr2^\u2212/\u2212^* mice ([Fig. 6B](#F6){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Nras^G12V^-induced senescence, measured by the increase in p21 or biotinylated Sudan Black B (Biotin-SBB)--positive hepatocytes ([Fig. 6C](#F6){ref-type=\"fig\"}) and in SA-\u03b2-Gal activity in the whole liver (fig. S7B), was impaired in *tlr2^\u2212/\u2212^* mice. In summary, these results indicate that *tlr2* is necessary for the induction of the SASP and the activation of OIS in vivo.\n\n![*tlr2* is necessary for SASP activation in vivo.\\\n(**A**) Representative IHC staining and IHC score quantification of IL-1\u03b1 in PanIN generated in *tlr2^+/+^* or *tlr2^\u2212/\u2212^ Pdx-Cre Kras^G12D^* mice.

S7C). We also identify new important SASP components, A-SAAs, which are the senescence-associated DAMPs sensed by TLR2 after oncogenic stress. Therefore, we are reporting that innate immune sensing is critical in senescence.\n\nWe propose that cellular senescence shares mechanistic features with the activation of innate immune cells and could be considered a program of the innate immune response by which somatic cells switch their regular role to acquire an immune function under certain conditions of stress and danger, for instance, upon oncogene activation. In OIS, super-enhancer elements regulated by Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) adjacent to the SASP have been shown to regulate the immune surveillance of senescent cells ([@R45]). In the same study, it was demonstrated that TLR pathways in general, and TLR2 in particular, were associated with activation of typical enhancers during OIS, suggesting that enhancer remodeling might shape the switch that activates this immune sensing program during senescence. In addition, cytosolic DNA sensing by the innate immune sensor cGAS has also been identified as an essential step in the activation of the SASP ([@R43], [@R46]). In our study, we have shown that the induction of TLR2 and A-SAAs depends on the activation of cGAS and STING in senescence, and they appear to function downstream of STING to regulate the SASP and NF-\u03baB (fig. S7C). Future research will be necessary to understand further the cross-talk between both pathways in senescence. For example, Dou *et al*. proposed that p38 MAPK signaling impairs the activation of the interferon response arm of the cGAS-STING pathway, prioritizing the NF-\u03baB response ([@R43]). In agreement, our data suggests that TLR2 and A-SAA expression is regulated through the NF-\u03baB, but not the IRF3, pathway downstream of cGAS-STING. We observed that TLR2 is essential for both the steady-state activation of p38 MAPK and NF-\u03baB during OIS. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that TLR2 may interact with the cGAS-STING pathway in senescence by actively impairing the activation of interferon response genes. As a result of these net interactions between innate immune receptors, TLR2 signaling is critical for the SASP and the cell cycle arrest and coincides with the role of both p38 MAPK and NF-\u03baB signal transduction pathways in OIS ([@R8], [@R10], [@R22], [@R34]).\n\nIn our experiments, we observed that TLR10 regulates a larger number of genes than TLR2. In contrast to the TLR2/10 coregulated genes, TLR10-specific genes were not directly related to inflammation. TLR10 is a largely under-characterized gene with undefined function, and in mice, it is a pseudogene inactivated by serial retrotransposition ([@R32]). Our study suggests a potential specific role for TLR10 in cellular senescence in human cells, with some possible TLR2-independent functions. However, further research will be necessary to clarify whether this subject is real or is the result of the higher efficiency of the siRNA reagent or the relative abundance between TLR2 and TLR10.\n\nBesides revealing a role for TLR2 in SASP induction and cell cycle regulation, we identified the DAMP that activates TLR2 in OIS. Acute-phase proteins SAA1 and SAA2 act to prime the TLR2-mediated inflammasome, and in turn, their full induction depends on TLR2 function. Hence, they establish a foundational feedback loop that controls the SASP (fig. S7C). A-SAAs are systemically produced in the liver and released into the bloodstream during an acute inflammatory response ([@R35]). Our identification of these molecules as mediators of senescence suggests that systemic elevation of A-SAAs might have an impact on the accumulation of senescent cells and the activation of their proinflammatory program at the organismal level. We found activation of TLR2 expression in parallel to A-SAAs in models of OIS in mice, in inflammation-induced senescence, in aging, and in different in vitro systems of senescence. Also, we have shown that TLR2 controls the activation of the SASP and OIS in vivo. Moreover, we have observed a dose-dependent effect for TLR2 in A-SAA sensing and a role for TLR2 in SASP activation during paracrine senescence. Together, these data suggest that systemic A-SAA elevation during acute inflammation could affect cells expressing TLR2, thereby promoting aging and other pathological roles of senescence. Further investigation may reveal additional physiological circumstances under which senescence is induced or reinforced by the interaction of TLR2 with A-SAAs or indeed with other endogenous DAMPs or exogenous PAMPs from the microbiome. These circumstances could have implications for organismal well-being, in particular, the development of aging and cancer.\n\nLast, in recent years, several strategies have been implemented to eliminate senescent cells or to modulate the activation of the SASP in anti-aging and cancer therapies (senotherapies) ([@R47]--[@R49]). For example, genetic targeting for the elimination of senescent cells can delay organismal aging and aging-associated disorders ([@R50], [@R51]). Furthermore, the pharmacological suppression of the SASP has been shown to improve homoeostasis in tissue damage and aging ([@R49]). However, most of these manipulations are directed to essential homeostatic regulators such as mTOR or crucial proinflammatory mediators such as IL-1 signaling. Here, we propose the alternative of manipulating A-SAA--TLR2 as a new rationale for senotherapies aiming to manipulate nonessential and senescence-specific signaling pathways.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n=====================\n\nCell culture\n------------\n\nHuman embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T and IMR90 female human fetal lung fibroblast cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. All cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific). IMR90 cells were kept at 5% CO~2~ and ambient O~2~ at 37\u00b0C. All cell lines were regularly tested for mycoplasma contamination using the MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza). Cell counting and viability were performed using the Muse Count and Viability Assay Kit in a Muse Cell Analyzer (Merck Millipore).\n\nExperiments with mice\n---------------------\n\nAll work was compiled with the U.K. Home Office guiding principles for the care and use of laboratory animals. Mice carrying a conditional *Pdx1-Cre Kras^G12D/+^* allele were used and have been described previously ([@R26]). Aging experiments were carried out on male WT C57BL/6 mice or male *nfkb1^\u2212/\u2212^* mice on a pure C57BL/6 background at 6.5, 9.5, and 24 months of age. For hydrodynamic tail vein injection experiments, *tlr2^\u2212/\u2212^* mice on a C57BL/6 background were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (JAX). Male and female *tlr2^\u2212/\u2212^* mice and WT siblings, aged between 8 to 12 weeks, were included in the study. Plasmids for hydrodynamic injection were prepared using the Qiagen Plasmid Maxi Kit (Qiagen, Germany), as per the manufacturer's instructions. Animals received 6 \u03bcg of a sleeping beauty transposase--encoding plasmid (CMV-SB 13 transposase), and 20 \u03bcg of NRas^G12V^/green fluorescent protein (GFP) encoding plasmid (pT3-NRas^G12V^-IRES-GFP) was diluted in physiological saline to 10% of the animal's body weight (approximately 2 ml) and delivered via the lateral tail vein within 10 s. Plasmid encoding an NRas^G12V^ effector loop mutant (pT3-NRas^G12V/D38A^-IRES-GFP), incapable of downstream NRas signaling, was used as a control. Mice were culled after 6 days, and liver tissue was harvested.\n\nChemical compounds and neutralizing antibodies\n----------------------------------------------\n\nOIS was induced by treating IMR90 ER:RAS cells with 100 nM 4OHT (Sigma-Aldrich). IMR90 ER:STOP was used as a negative control. To induce senescence, IMR90 cells were treated with 100 \u03bcM etoposide for 48 hours, followed by 5 days in normal culture media, or with 10 \u03bcM palbociclib or 10 \u03bcM Nutlin 3a for 7 days. TLR2 was blocked by incubating cells with anti-TLR2 (10 \u03bcg/ml) (MAB2616, R&D system) or immunoglobulin G2B isotype control. Chemical inhibitors used were 10 \u03bcM BAY-117082 (Calbiochem), 10 \u03bcM SB202190 (Calbiochem), and OxPAPC (100 \u03bcg/ml) (Invivogen). TLR2 in IMR90 cells was primed with recombinant human Apo-SAA (10 \u03bcg/ml; PeproTech, catalog no. 300-30) or Pam2SK4 (1 \u03bcg/ml; Tocris, catalog no. 4637).\n\nConditioned medium for paracrine senescence transmission\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor the production of conditional medium used in paracrine senescence, IMR90 ER:STOP or ER:RAS cells were cultured with 100 nM 4OHT in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS for 4 days, followed by DMEM supplemented with 1% FBS and 4OHT for an additional 4 days. The resulting conditioned medium was filtered with 0.2-\u03bcm syringe filters (Millipore) and reconstituted with a solution of DMEM supplemented with 40% FBS at a ratio of 3:1.\n\nConstruction of plasmids\n------------------------\n\nTLR2 complementary DNA (cDNA) was amplified from the pcDNA3-TLR2-YFP plasmid (Addgene, 13016) using primers flanked with Xho I sites. Amplified genes were cloned into the MSCV-puro vector. pLN-ER:RAS, LSXN-ER:Stop, MSCV-Ras^G12V^, CMV-VSVG, and pNGVL-Gag-Pol vectors were described elsewhere ([@R15]).\n\nRetroviral production and infection\n-----------------------------------\n\nFor retroviral production, retroviral vectors were cotransfected with VSV-G envelope plasmid and Gag-Pol helper vector using polyethylenimine linear (molecular weight, 25.000; Polysciences) into HEK293T cells. Viral supernatant was collected from the HEK293T cells 2 days after transfection and passed through a 0.45-\u03bcm syringe filter (Merck Millipore) to eliminate cells. The viral supernatant was supplemented with hexadimethrine bromide (4 \u03bcg/ml; polybrene) (Sigma-Aldrich) and used to incubate IMR90 cells, with subsequent viral supernatant collection and treatment of IMR90 cells every 3 hours. After three rounds of infection, the medium was changed to fresh DMEM with 10% FBS, and cells were allowed to grow for 2 to 3 days before selection with puromycin (1 \u03bcg/ml) (Invivogen) for another 7 days before seeding for indicated experiments.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\n--------------------\n\nFormalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections were dewaxed, rehydrated through graded ethanol solutions (100, 90, and 70%), and washed in distilled H~2~O. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by immersing sections H~2~O~2~ (H1009, Sigma). To retrieve antigens, sections were boiled in 0.01 M citrate (pH 6.0), except for Tlr2 staining where antigens were retrieved using proteinase K (20 \u03bcg/ml). Sections were incubated with the primary antibody overnight at 4\u00b0C (antibody information is provided in table S3). For the *Pdx1-Cre Kras^G12D/+^* mice experiment, the EnVision+ Dual Link System-HRP (DAB+) Kit (K4065, Dako) was used for Ki67 staining. The total number of Ki67-positive cells per PanIN and the total cells per PanIN were counted, and thus, the percentage of Ki67-positive cells per PanIN was calculated. The mean score for each mouse was calculated, and these scores were plotted on a box plot. Consecutive sections were stained with antibodies against Tlr2 and Saa1. For the *nfkb^\u2212/\u2212^* mice experiment, biotinylated secondary antibody was added and detected using the rabbit peroxidase ABC Kit (PK-4001, Vector Laboratories), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Substrate was developed using the NovaRED Kit (SK-4800, Vector Laboratories). Staining was analyzed with a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope, and images were captured with a Leica DFC420 camera using the LAS software (Leica). Ten to 15 random images were captured per section, and the percentage of positively stained cells determined from total number of cells before an average per mouse was calculated. For the hydrodynamic tail vein injection experiment, biotinylated secondary antibodies were added and detected using the R.T.U Vectastain Kit (PK-7100, Vector). Substrate was developed using the DAB substrate Kit (ab64238, Abcam). Staining was analyzed with a Hamamatsu NanoZoomer XR microscope, and images were captured using the NDP scan v.3.1 software (Hamamatsu).\n\nWhole-mount SA-\u03b2-Gal staining\n-----------------------------\n\nSnap-frozen liver samples were thawed before fixing in 2% formaldehyde/0.2% glutaraldehyde solution for 30 min at room temperature. Samples were subsequently washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated at 37\u00b0C overnight in the dark in \u03b2-Gal staining solution \\[5 mM K~3~FE (CN)~6~ and 5 mM K~4~Fe (CN) ~6~\\*3H~2~O in PBS, X-Gal solution (1 mg/ml), 150 mM NaCl, and 2 mM MgCl~2~ at pH 6 in citric acid/phosphate buffer\\]. Samples were then washed, dehydrated, and imaged.\n\nBiotin-SBB detection in paraffin-embedded sections\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nFor Biotin-SBB IHC, paraffin-embedded sections were dewaxed, rehydrated, and blocked as per other IHC samples. Samples were immersed in additional graded ethanol washes before incubation with a Biotin-SBB analog (SenTraGor), which selectively binds to lipofuscin, for 8 min at room temperature. Samples were washed and then incubated with primary antibiotin antibody (see table S3) overnight at 4\u00b0C. The samples were then incubated with a horseradish peroxidase--conjugated secondary antibody for 1 hour at room temperature, and then, substrate was developed using the DAB substrate Kit (ab64238, Abcam). Staining was analyzed with a Hamamatsu NanoZoomer XR microscope, and images were captured using the NDP scan v 3.1 software (Hamamatsu). The antibodies used are in table S3.\n\nHerrings-testes DNA transfection\n--------------------------------\n\nMR90 cells were seeded into six-well tissue culture plates, incubated overnight, and transfected with 2500 ng of herrings-testes DNA using Lipofectamine 2000, following the manufacturer's protocol. Samples collected for analysis 24 hours after transfection.\n\nsiRNA transfection\n------------------\n\nReverse siRNA transfection was carried out using 30 nM siRNA (Dharmacon, GE Healthcare). siRNA sequences are provided in table S2. DharmaFECT 1 (Dharmacon, GE Healthcare) transfection reagent was diluted in DMEM and added to the siRNA-containing wells. This complex was allowed to form while cells were trypsinized and prepared for plating. IMR90 ER:RAS or ER:STOP cells (2000 cells per well in a 96-well plate; 66,000 cells per well in a six-well plate) were plated into the siRNA-containing wells with 100 nM 4OHT for the activation of ER:RAS. Because of the transient nature of siRNA to maintain the knockdown for up to 8 days, the cells were forward-transfected with medium containing the same proportions of siRNA, transfection reagent, and 4OHT on days 3 and 5. A list of the siRNA reagents is provided in table S2.\n\nTotal RNA preparation and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRNA was extracted from IMR90 cells using the RNeasy Plus Kit (Qiagen), following the manufacturer's instructions. For mRNA expression in murine livers, snap-frozen specimens were homogenized with trizole, and RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy plus mini kit (Qiagen, Germany), according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was synthesized using qScript cDNA SuperMix (Quanta Biosciences), following the manufacturer's instructions, from 1 \u03bcg of RNA in a 40-\u03bcl reaction. qRT-PCR was performed using 1 \u03bcl of cDNA as a template per reaction well and SYBR Select Master Mix (Life Technologies) using 200 nM of forward and reverse primers in 20 \u03bcl. Samples were run in triplicate on a StepOnePlus Cycler (Thermo Fisher Scientific).\n\nFor the nfkb^\u2212/\u2212^ aging experiment, RNA was extracted from solubilized lung tissue using the RNeasy Mini Kit (74106, Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was generated using the Omniscript RT Kit (205110, Qiagen) as per the user manual. qRT-PCR was performed using 4 \u03bcl of cDNA as a template per reaction well using a Power SYBR Green (4367659, Invitrogen) PCR Master Mix and 100 nM of forward and reverse primers to form a final reaction volume of 10 \u03bcl. Samples were run in triplicate in a C1000TM Thermal Cycler, CFX96TM Real-Time System (Bio-Rad), and Bio-Rad CXF manager software.\n\nmRNA expression analysis was carried out using the change in Ct method and normalized to levels of the housekeeping gene actin or ribosomal protein 18*S* (nfkb^\u2212/\u2212^ experiment only) to obtain relative mRNA expression. All primers used are listed in the table S1.\n\nImmunofluorescence and high-content microscopy\n----------------------------------------------\n\nAll immunofluorescence staining and imaging was performed on the ImageXpress high-content analysis microscope (Molecular Devices), as previously described ([@R52]). All steps were carried out at room temperature. Following the indicated treatment, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 hour and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min. After three washes with PBS, the cells were blocked with 0.2% fish-skin gelatin/bovine serum albumin (BSA)/PBS for 1 hour. Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking solution as indicated and incubated for 30 min, followed by three washes in PBS. Appropriately conjugated Alexa Fluor secondary antibodies were diluted 1:1000 in blocking solution and incubated on the cells for 40 min, followed by an additional three washes in PBS. Last, 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (1 \u03bcg/ml) was added to the cells for 20 min, after which the plates underwent a final round of washes before imaging on the ImageXpress microscope. Quantification of immunofluorescence images was conducted using the MetaXpress software (Molecular Devices), as previously described ([@R52]).\n\nWestern blot analysis\n---------------------\n\nWhole-cell lysates were prepared by lysing the cells with an appropriate volume of radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer \\[10 mM tris (pH 7.4), 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 10% glycerol, phosphatase inhibitor cocktail III, protease inhibitor cocktail V, and EDTA free\\]. Lysates were incubated on ice for 15 min before centrifuging at 14,000 rpm for 20 min to clear lysates. Supernatants were collected into a clean tube and quantified using the Bradford assay. Samples were prepared for loading by mixing with Laemmli sample buffer and boiled at 95\u00b0C for 5 min. Protein samples were resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane using the iBlot Dry Blotting System (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Membranes were blocked for 1 hour in 5% milk/tris-buffered saline--1% Tween (TBST). Indicated primary antibodies were diluted in 5% milk/TBST or 5% BSA/TBST and incubated at 4\u00b0C with gentle agitation overnight. Blots were washed for a minimum of three times in TBST for more than 30 min. Secondary antibodies were prepared in 5% milk/TBST, and membranes were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. Blots were washed as before, and then, enhanced chemical luminescence (Amersham) detection reagent was applied for detection. Antibody information is provided in table S3.\n\nCell proliferation assays\n-------------------------\n\nThe 5-bromo-2\u2032-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assay was used to measure the number of cells actively replicating DNA. Cells were treated as indicated in 96-well plates and incubated with 10 \u03bcM BrdU (Sigma) for 16 to 18 hours before fixation and immunostained as described using anti-BrdU antibody with deoxyribonuclease (0.5 U/\u03bcl) (Sigma) in 1 mM MgCl containing PBS.\n\nTo visualize and quantify long-term growth, cells were plated at low density (50,000 cells/10-cm plate) and maintained for 10 to 15 days. The cells were fixed using 1% glutaraldehyde (Sigma) for 1 hour and dried overnight before staining with 0.15% crystal violet solution for 2 hours. The plates were then washed, dried, and scanned for documentation. For quantification, crystal violet was extracted from stained plates with 1% acetic acid and quantified by absorbance read at 595 nm.\n\nSA-\u03b2-Gal assay\n--------------\n\nSA-\u03b2-Gal staining solution was prepared using 20\u00d7 KC \\[100 mM K~3~FE (CN)~6~ and 100 mM K~4~Fe (CN) ~6~\\*3H~2~O in PBS\\], 20\u00d7 X-Gal solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific) diluted to 1\u00d7 in PBS/1 mM MgCl~2~ at pH 5.5 to 6. The cells were treated as indicated and fixed in 0.5% glutaraldehyde (Sigma) for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were washed twice in PBS/1 mM MgCl~2~ (pH 5.5 to 6) before incubation in 2 ml of staining solution for 24 hours at 37\u00b0C.\n\nAmpliSeq transcriptome profiling\n--------------------------------\n\nRNA samples were assessed for quality on the Agilent Bioanalyzer with the RNA Nano Chip, providing an RNA Integrity Number. Samples were quantified using the Qubit 2.0 fluorometer and the Qubit RNA Broad Range assay. Ten nanograms of RNA was reverse-transcribed to make cDNA, and then, target genes were amplified for 12 cycles of PCR using the Ion AmpliSeq Human Gene Expression Core Panel. This panel contains 20,802 amplicons (41,604 primers) of approximately 150 bases in length in a single pool. Ion Torrent sequencing adapters and barcodes were ligated to the amplicons, and adapter-ligated libraries were purified using AMPure XP beads. Libraries were quantified by qPCR and diluted to 100 pM. Templates were prepared using the Ion PI Hi-Q OT2 200 Kit and sequenced using the Ion PI Hi-Q Sequencing 200 Kit. The Ion Proton platform was used to analyze the data. Analysis of gene expression was performed using the software package Babelomics 5.0 ([@R53], [@R54]). Statistical analysis of significance was performed using Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate multiple test. GSEA was performed using GSEA 3.0 software from the Broad Institute ([www.gsea-msigdb.org](http://www.gsea-msigdb.org)) ([@R55]). Gene ontology analysis was performed using DAVID functional annotation web resource (<https://david-d.ncifcrf.gov>).\n\nDetermination of IL-1\u03b2 in conditioned medium\n--------------------------------------------\n\nSupernatant of medium from siRNA-treated cells was collected for the analysis of IL-1\u03b2 content. The medium was combined with 6\u00d7 Laemmli sample buffer, and IL-1\u03b2 expression was determined by immunoblotting, as described. Conditional medium samples were also analyzed for IL-1\u03b2 expression by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using the Human IL-1\u03b2 ELISA Ready-Set-Go!

{"text": "Increasingly, the noncovalent \"wrapping\" and \"encapsulating\" of polymer chains on carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) are interesting phenomena, which have been widely studied in theoretical and experimental researches[@b1][@b2][@b3][@b4]. The polymer adhered to SWNTs can aid the solubility and dispersion of intact SWNTs[@b5][@b6][@b7], enhance the mechanical strength, electrical conduction, and optical nonlinearity of the polymer matrix[@b8][@b9] and functionalize the SWNTs[@b10][@b11]. Moreover, the noncovalent polymer stacking (CH-\u03c0 or \u03c0--\u03c0) on SWNT surface controlled by the balance of attractive/repulsive forces within and between molecules can drive self-assembly mechanisms[@b12][@b13]. Self-assembly can result in truly unique and highly ordered structures that such materials may not only be designed to be highly dynamic, displaying adaptive and self-healing properties, but also help gain an understanding of the rules that govern molecular assembly processes[@b14].\n\nThe existence of helical folding in biopolymers like proteins and nucleic acids is very important, which direct the sophisticated functions in living systems. Inspired by biological helices, the polymers are expected to be designed with controlled helicity functions[@b15][@b16][@b17][@b18] to design elongated supramolecular architectures. The new and reliable method for unambiguously constructing and determining single- and double-stranded helical polymers are important and urgent challenges in this area. The single- and double-helical structure confined within a SWNT is of significant importance, which may provide a new system that mimics the unique adaptive, dynamic and complex molecular models found in nature[@b19][@b20]. It is the new technology and ability to design and enforce a one-dimensional helical morphology within the hollow space of SWNT[@b21][@b22][@b23], which will result in diverse functional polymer-SWNT complexes for a wide range of applications in electronics and biomedicine.\n\nThe present study discovers that the polymers, which possessing planar configuration, can self-assemble within SWNTs to form single- and double-helix. The SWNT surface provides adsorption stress to bend polymer chains such that they attach onto the inner surface of SWNT and roll up to self-assemble. The SWNT size, the flexibility and nanostructures of polymer chain are all determine the outcome of the nanostructures. To fully understand the potential of such functional systems, the basic interaction between the polymer and the nanotubes is investigated, and the condition and mechanism of the helix-forming are also particularly explained. Of significant importance is that this study provides scientific basis for designing and fabricating helical polymers encapsulated in SWNT and eventually on their applications in various fields.\n\nResults\n=======\n\nThe present work aims to reveal the helix-forming process, especially the condition and mechanism of the polymer when encapsulating into the SWNT at an atomic level. Polypyrrole (PPY) is a type of organic polymer, which is widely used in electronic devices and chemical sensors[@b24]. The Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded in 2000 for work on conductive polymers including PPY[@b25]. Our simulations show that the PPY with strict planar construction can easily form single- and double-helix inside the SWNT. Direct simulations in [Fig. 1](#f1){ref-type=\"fig\"} provide the representative snapshots of one and two PPY chains helically inserting into the SWNT (20, 20) (See the [video 1](#S1){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"} in the [Supporting Information](#S1){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"} for the detailed inserting processes). The inset (a) is the repeat unit for the rigid backbone of PPY. The length of the SWNT is 49.19 \u00c5 and the PPY is built in a head-to-tail configuration with the length of 300.61 \u00c5. Because of natural curl characteristics, the single PPY chain twists or bents in a free space showing one-dimensional wavy fluctuation like a worm.\n\nIf one end of the PPY is captured by the inner space of SWNT and the deformation force from the PPY itself is overcome, the polymer adheres onto the tube wall quickly owing to the vdW coupling. As the simulation progresses, interactions from the so-called vdW potential well gradually pull the polymer chains inside the SWNT in a straight line (t\u2009=\u20090\\~2\u2009ns), in which the PPY are held tightly against the sidewall of the tube and the fluctuations vanish owing to the interaction between them. After reaches to the end of the tube, The chain are then pushed further inwards by the parts still located outside the tube, which continue to enter the SWNT in a helical fashion. While the PPY head has formed a helical configuration with large pitch instead of overflow the tube. The PPY forms a coil when the time is up to 7\u2009ns. Then the PPY heads are pushed to move forward circumferentially because of the curvature of the tube wall. Eventually, a perfect single-helix, with remarkably constant gap of 3.5\u2009\u00c5 between neighboring spirals, fills up the SWNTs at 10\u2009ns. The self-assembled PPY-SWNT system achieves dynamic equilibrium through spontaneous insertion. The handedness of the PPY helix is determined by the initial deflection of the captured end, which can be right- or left-handed with equal probability.\n\nDouble-helix can also be formed when two PPY chains encapsulating into the (20, 20) SWNT, the evolution process is illustrated in [Fig. 1(b)](#f1){ref-type=\"fig\"} (see [Video 2](#S1){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"} in [Supporting Information](#S1){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"} for detailed encapsulation process). Two PPY chains are separated for about 2\u2009nm at one end of the tube. As the simulation starts, two PPY chains contact each other rapidly through \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions between them. They also fill the tube in a straight way due to the effect of vdW potential well and, the head of the polymer chains reach the other end of the SWNT after 1\u2009ns. Then the polymer chains begin to bend into a helical shape within the confined space at 7\u2009ns. Eventually, a perfect double-helix with equal periodicity forms inside the SWNT at 10\u2009ns. Two polymer chains always contact each other during the filling process, suggesting that the \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking effect between the two chains should be stronger than that in the PPY-SWNT system. It is should noting that the double-stranded helical polymer is similar to the DNA. The similarity could be a clue to the potential applications of this double-helix structure and one of the most heralded inorganic nanomaterials.\n\nIn addition, the dependence of the helix formation on diameter and chirality of SWNT has been further studied. It has known that the chirality of SWNTs have a significant effect on their properties, which can change from metallic when they adopt an armchair chirality to semiconducting or semimetallic when they are zigzag or chiral[@b26]. [Figure 2(a,b)](#f2){ref-type=\"fig\"} show that a helical structure is obtained for one and two polymer chains in the (16, 16) and (17, 17) armchair SWNTs, respectively. Whereas in SWNTs (15, 15) and (16, 16) with smaller diameters the polymer keeps curving or straight pattern for one and two PPYs. If the diameter of the SWNT is smaller enough, the polymer cannot be encapsulated in the nanotube. As the diameter increases, the polymer chains can produce a perfect single and double helix inside the SWNT and polymer helix with a constant pitch to reduce the curvature of chains and keep the whole system stable. To investigate the effect of chirality on the system, four types of SWNTs including (35, 0), (30, 8), (24, 16), and (20, 20) are chosen, which have different chiral angles \u03b8 ranging from 0 to 30\u00b0 and similar diameters about 22.7\u2009\u01fa. The chiral angle \u03b8 and corresponding diameter of the SWNTs with (n, m) indices can be determined by using the rolling GN model[@b27]. The total number of atoms, diameter, and length of each chiral nanotube are nearly the same. [Figure 2(c)](#f2){ref-type=\"fig\"} shows the final helical nanostructures of the polymer molecules in SWNTs after the MD simulations. There is a slight effect of the chiral angles \u03b8 on the pitch of the helical nanostructures and the distances of the adjacent gaps was kept constant within 9.4 to 9.6\u2009\u01fa.\n\nThe interaction of SWNT and some non-planar and planar polymers are simulated. The repeat unit of poly(thiodiazole) (PT), Poly(p_benzamide) (PBA), Poly(p_thalimide) (PTI), Poly(benz_imidazoles) (PBI), Polyacetylene (PA), Poly(benzothiazole) (PBT) with planar structure are shown in [Fig. 3](#f3){ref-type=\"fig\"}. [Table 1](#t1){ref-type=\"table\"} gives the full information of these polymers used in this study. As expected, only these polymers with planar configuration can encapsulate the SWNT and show some helical structure more or less when the system saturates. Some correlations of helical bending to their corresponding polymeric species can be seen from the molecular conformations at 20\u2009ns that shown in [Fig. 4](#f4){ref-type=\"fig\"}.\n\nConsidering that nanodevices may be need more species of polymer, it endeavors to rationally design hybrid helix in nanotubes, which will result in responsive, multiplexed and photostable polymer probes. [Figure 5](#f5){ref-type=\"fig\"} shows the formed configuration of hybrid helix in SWNTs. Several recent reports has demonstrated that graphene nanoribbon (GNR) is able to encapsulate into the SWNT and form a perfect helical structure spontaneously as a result of the \u03c0--\u03c0 stacking between GNR and SWNT[@b28][@b29][@b30][@b31]. This peculiar phenomenon prompts us to design the GNR-polymer hybrid helix. The GNR utilized was 7.38\u2009\u00c5 in width and the SWNT (20, 20) was 59.03 in length. GNR with polymers PA and PBI can form perfect double-helix. If the PBI is long enough, its end will insert the inner space of GNR helix to form a hybrid double-walled helix. In the helix of GNR and PA, the PA chain has more intense vibration than that of GNR. It is notable that two different polymers are easier to form hybrid helix showing that hybrid improves the ability of the helix-forming.\n\nDiscussion\n==========\n\nIt is essential to answer why the planar polymer can encapsulate into the SWNT spontaneously and stick on the tube wall in a spiral manner. Theoretically, the short polymer exhibits a worm-like chain conformation sustained by its intrinsic bending strain energy, though the polymer will tend to agglomerate driven by thermal fluctuation and lose orientational order when it is very long. The deformation and helix-forming are attributed to the competition between the vdW interaction energy and the bending strain energy of the polymer, which always tends to keep the intrinsic chain form and provide an energy barrier to structure transition. When the SWNT approaches, the attractive vdW force can help the polymer overpass the energy barrier to deform. During the self-assembly, the potential energy of the system transits into vdW attraction between polymer and SWNT. As illustrated in [Fig. 6(a)](#f6){ref-type=\"fig\"}, the negative \u0394*E*~vdW~, indicating an attractive force, has increased dramatically and finally reaches the highest energy states, which are changed nearly synchronous with that of *E*~P~ during the whole helix-forming process. In this course, the vdW is partially converted into the internal energy, which drives the geometry deformation of polymer, and partially transforms to kinetic energy, which sustains the structure transition. Therefore, the vdW interaction between the polymer and the SWNT plays a dominant role in helix-forming.\n\nThe offset \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interaction[@b32] between the polymer and the SWNT also plays a significant role in the helical self-assembly. It can be validated from the concentration distribution profiles of the composite structures in the X directions ([Fig. 6(b)](#f6){ref-type=\"fig\"}) that the separation between polymer plane and SWNT is exactly close to 3.5\u2009\u00c5, which in accordance with the parallel stacking distance of the offset \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions. The partial enlarged details of the helical polymers inside SWNTs in [Fig. 7](#f7){ref-type=\"fig\"} also demonstrate that the ring planes of polymers is offset from SWNTs' and their centroid-centroid distances are all between 3.6 and 3.8\u2009\u00c5, which is lower in energy than other face-face and T-shaped stacking arrangements according to the typical aromatic-aromatic offset \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking[@b33]. It speculates that the offset \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions can provide two key elements for the formation of a helix, one is an energetic contribution that stems from the stacking itself, and such a contribution can thermodynamically drive the helix-forming process; the other is specific directionality and orientation provided by the specific pattern of stacking[@b34] that determines the parallel separations of polymer plane and SWNT. Thus, the best way to keep the displaced stacking and the most contact area of polymers and SWNT is that the arrangement of the polymer follows a helical mode and paralleled arrangement when increasingly longer polymer is trapped inside the tube. Moreover, the displacement of the carbon rings favors to minimize the repulsive \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction and maximize the attractive \u03c0-\u03c3 interaction. Therefore, in the polymer-SWNT systems, parallel displaced offset \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking should be the major organization of \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction displacement and plays a dominant role in helix-formation. The driving forces for forming these configurations are most likely a combination of vdW force and \u03c0-\u03c0 staking[@b28][@b35]. Firstly, the vdW interaction draws and traps the polymers inside the tube; then the offset \u03c0-\u03c0 staking interaction guides the chains to self-assemble and display a helical configuration.\n\nThe most important factor is that the polymer must possess a planar structure to guide displaced stacking in the system. It is because the three-dimensional hydrogen bond and side-groups enlarge the distance between polymer and SWNT, which will destroy the displaced stacking and prefer to coil rather than form helix[@b36], just as shown in [Fig. 4](#f4){ref-type=\"fig\"}. Moreover, the moderate flexibility of the polymer chains also contributes to helical formation ability of the polymer during encapsulation. PA has a relative stiff backbone, which make a PA chain fill the entire diameter of the SWNT and fold up into loops rather than helix. While two PAs restraining each other to enhance the flexibility, which combine with the noncovalent \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking between PA and SWNT wall allowing them to form a perfect double helix. When the head of a single PA retraces and meet the other part of the PA, a helical pattern also presents (see [Fig. 4](#f4){ref-type=\"fig\"}). This \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking is that the C-C double bonds of the PA interacts with the \u03c0-electrons of six-membered ring of SWNT. Though these \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions of PA and SWNT is significantly weaker than \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking between rings, C-C double bonds are very abundant and this \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking can provide the crucial driving force in the helix-forming process of PA in SWNT.\n\nWhile the too flexible polymer chains, such as poly (ethylene) (PE)[@b23], prefer to coil up and agglomerate with intrachain interactions rather than interact with the SWNT. Because the T-shaped CH-\u03c0 stacking between PE and SWNT is weaker than PE intrachain force, and can not drive PE to adhere onto SWNT wall and form helix. PBI and PPY possess moderate flexibility to form single- and double-helix, which retain their planar structure in the whole encapsulation. Aromatic moieties along the backbone of PBI and PPY prefer to optimize and enhance the \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and dictate the adsorbed helix conformation[@b37]. The nitrogenous rings of PPY and PBI strength the \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking with six-membered rings in the SWNT and the introduction of nitrogen to the rings increases the tendency to stack, as shown in [Fig. 7](#f7){ref-type=\"fig\"}. Moreover, recent studies have suggested that a combination of the backbone stiffness and aromaticity (and thus \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions with the SWNTs) can stabilize polymer adsorption to the SWNT surface and can also lead to enhanced functionalization[@b38][@b39][@b40].\n\nThe inserted PBA and PTI chains are actively interacting with the SWNT wall and take a helical pattern. The ability of forming helix is lower than above three polymers. The reason is that the atoms N that join molecules make adjacent molecular structures relatively rotate. The rotation causes the faces of the neighboring molecules almost perpendicular. Though aromatic rings of polymer strengthen the \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions with SWNT, the relatively rotation increases the flexibility of the chain backbones and enlarges the interaction distance between polymers and SWNT wall, which hinder the formation of helix. For PBT and PT, their stiff backbones latch onto the SWNT surface owing to the presence \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction of five- and six-membered rings with six-membered rings in SWNT, has a greater tendency to bend in a helical pattern. However, C-S bonds reinforce the stiffness of the backbones, which make PT and PBT only have a helical tendency in the SWNT length and cannot bend anymore to form helix. In comparison, poly(styrene) (PS) and poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), though the aromatic rings make them latch onto the SWNT dominated by \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions, the contained three dimensional C-H bonds weaken the interaction of the whole chain with tube wall and make the polymer coil up or form S-shaped arrangement along one side of the SWNT instead of helical conformation[@b23].\n\nTherefore, three factors should be considered to promote and enhance the formation of a perfect helical structure. (1) The polymer should possess a planar configuration, which will guide and strengthen the displaced stacking in the system; (2) the moderate flexibility of the polymer chains, which cause the chain to bend and form helix; (3) strong interactions between polymer and SWNT, which will act as the driving force for self-assembly.\n\nThis study provides a direct observation that the polymer with planar structure can be activated and guided to encapsulating the inner space of SWNT and form a new helix on a molecular scale. The vdW attraction drive the polymer to fill the SWNT and the \u03c0-\u03c0 staking interactions between polymer and SWNT wall guide the chains to self-assemble to display a helical configuration and cause polymer and SWNT wall with the spacing of 3.5\u2009\u00c5. The diameter of the tube that PPY chains can form single- and double-strand helix should be larger than that of SWNT (17, 17) and (18, 18), respectively. But the SWNT chirality has a negligible influence on the helical-encapsulation. Hybrid double-helix has also been designed and hybrid improves the ability of the helix-forming. To obtain a perfect helix, the polymer should possess a planar configuration, because the three-dimensional hydrogen bond and side-groups enlarge the distance between polymer and SWNT, which will destroy the displaced stacking and prefer to coil rather than forming helix. Furthermore, the polymer should have moderate flexibility and strong interactions with SWNT. Of significant interest is that the proposed discoveries provide the theoretical basis for designing and fabricating single- and double-helix nanostructured polymers inside SWNTs via self-assembly and eventually on their applications in various areas.\n\nMethods\n=======\n\nAll calculations are performed using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, which is an effective tool for studying material behavior at the nanometer scale and providing detailed information at the atomic level. The force-field of condensed-phase optimized molecular potentials for atomistic simulation studies (COMPASS)[@b41] was applied to model the atomic interaction. The COMPASS is an *ab initio* force-field that is parameterized and validated using condensed-phase properties in addition to various *ab initio* and empirical data. It aims to achieve high accuracy in prediction of the properties of very complex mixtures[@b42][@b43], and it has been proven to be applicable in describing the properties of graphene and SWNTs[@b44][@b45] and the interaction of polymer and SWNT[@b46][@b47]. The Andersen method in the thermostat was applied to control the temperature and generate the correct statistical ensemble. The thermodynamic temperature was kept constant by allowing the simulated system to exchange energy with a \"heating bath\". The initial velocities of all atoms followed a temperature-dependent Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution and the Verlet algorithm was adopted to integrate the motion of equations of the whole system.\n\nIn this study, all the MD simulations were performed in vacuum at 298\u2009K and different SWNTs and polymer chains were studied. Each of the system was simulated long enough to achieve an equilibrium state. The SWNTs were frozen as rigid structures to simplify the computational analysis of the run. Initially, polymers were placed at the entrances of the SWNTs along the axial direction and overlapped 15\u2009\u00c5 with the SWNTs in order to overcome the deformation force from the polymers themselves and insure the distances between them are in the range of the cutoff distance of van der Waals (vdW) interaction. Then the models were put into a canonical ensemble molecular dynamics (NVT-MD) simulation. The time step was set to be 1.0\u2009fs. Data were collected every 5.0\u2009ps to record the full-precision trajectory and the results were further analyzed.\n\nAdditional Information\n======================\n\n**How to cite this article**: Fu, H. *et al*.

{"text": "Elder abuse at nursing homes is real, and it\u2019s quite disturbing and disheartening.\n\nWhile it may be shocking to even think that some people, let alone nursing home staff, are capable of hurting or abusing elders, statistics reveals just how monstrous and awful some of the nursing homes in Los Angeles and all across California are.\n\nFact: nearly 10% of all of our country\u2019s nursing homes had violations and were either a priori deemed dangerous or had documented cases of serious injury or abuse-caused death of elderly residents.\n\nFact #2: over 40% of nursing home residents have reported elder abuse, and a staggering more than 90% said they have witnessed another resident of the facility being abused.\n\nThe statistics are surely disturbing, especially if you\u2019re considering to place your parent or grandparent in a nursing home in Los Angeles or elsewhere in California anytime soon.\n\nDisturbing elder abuse incident grabs headlines\n\nA reputable Los Angeles-based law firm JML Law, which has handled elder abuse cases in California for the past 35 years, warns that placing your loved one in a nursing home without examining the facility\u2019s standards of care, hiring practices and other factors poses a series of risks.\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t want your mom or dad, grandma or grandpa, abused at the facility where they are supposed to be treated with care and love.\n\nOne elder abuse incident, in particular, has recently sent off waves of shock all across the U.S., when a hidden camera footage showed a celebrated World War II veteran asking for help and gasping for breath, while nursing home staff in his room laughed at him.\n\nThe video was leaked as part of a lawsuit into the death of James Dempsey, 89, of Woodstock, Ga., a decorated World War II veteran, who passed away back in February 2014. It took staff nearly an hour to call 911 after Mr Dempsey was found unresponsive.\n\nThe hidden camera video shows Mr Dempsey asking for help six times, before becoming unconscious while gasping for air. Lawyers representing Mr Dempsey\u2019s two sons and two grandchildren were successful in holding the Northeast Atlanta Health and Rehabilitation nursing home staff liable for the war veteran\u2019s death.\n\nFamily members had installed the hidden camera in Mr Dempsey\u2019s room before his death. Without the footage, the family would not have known how the war veteran died or that the nursing home staff\u2019s inexcusable actions, failure to respond and unlawful conduct caused his death.\n\nNote: the nursing home\u2019s lawyers attempted to keep the video sealed with an appeal, but eventually failed.\n\nHow to avoid placing your loved one in an abusive nursing home\n\nThis case alone makes you wonder: since little to no nursing homes are equipped with cameras \u2013 and surviving family members rarely get to see footage of their loved one\u2019s death at a nursing home \u2013 how many elderly residents of these facilities die due to staff\u2019s failure to respond?\n\nSpeaking from their own experience, Los Angeles elder abuse attorneys at JML Law, who have had unparalleled track record of obtaining compensation for elder abuse neglect, unlawful misconduct and other wrongdoing at nursing homes, hundreds of nearly 1.5 billion elderly residents in the U.S. may be dying due to failure to respond, failure to assess and failure to act, and other forms of elderly abuse at nursing homes, every year.\n\nElder abuse attorneys at JML Law perform background checks on nursing homes in Los Angeles and all across California; they examine patients\u2019 medical records, interview nursing home residents, they look into care facility hiring practices as well as standards of care, among many other things.\n\nHiring a Los Angeles elder abuse attorney to perform these checks may be the only way to ensure that you\u2019re placing your parents or grandparents in a safe, abuse-free facility.\n\nConsult an elderly abuse lawyer by calling JML Law at 818-610-8800 today or send an email to get a free initial consultation.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "Pile-CC"}}

{"text": "Q:\n\nEntity Framework and inconsistent performance with processing the results of a query\n\nJust setup New Relic on our site and we noticed some odd spikes in one of our webapi calls.\nAt this point I have the problem boiled down to a single EF query that I moved out to its own method so I could use New Relic to instrument it..\nThe only thing the method does is\n//I changed this from ToListAsync to ToList to see if it would help\nvar result = Context.Data.Where(x=> x.id = id).ToList();\nreturn result;\n\nThat's it.. \nUsing New Relic and also logging out all the SQL queries I'm fairly positive the issue isn't with the query being slow. New Relic says the method is only spending an average of 339 ms running against the DB and I see similar numbers from the trace data coming from EF. But the methods average execution time is 16 seconds. \nNormally this method executes in under 2 seconds but every so often EF just seems to go off into lala land and it takes 60 or 70 seconds to finish whatever it's doing. But I've never seen the DB query itself take longer then 500 ms. And the query is retrieving pretty much the exact same dataset every time it runs..\nI noticed in the logs that the long wait time was always between executing the query and closing the connection..

So the load is pretty much non existent.\nI've tried to recreate this locally but haven't been able to...

Officially designated by the jewelry industry, items may only be sold as vermeil if they have a minimum thickness of 100 millionths of an inch (2.5 microns) of gold over the silver. Regular gold plating is less than 2.5 microns.\n\nThe \"vermeil\" technique of plating sterling silver with gold originated in France in the 1750s. It differs from \"gold filled\" or \"gold plated\" in terms of the thickness or thinness of the microns over sterling silver. \"Gold filled\" pieces have a much thicker layer, between 15 and 45 microns, which is mechanically bonded to the base metal with heat and pressure. Vermeil is a more expensive version of \"gold plated\". It does not wear off as quickly as gold plating does.

The iron that creates peridot\u2019s color is an integral part of its structure, so the gem is only found in various shades of green. It is most prized in lime hues, but Italian peridot is a rich olive color and popular American peridot is a beautiful light yellow-green. The Romans called peridot \u201cevening emerald\u201d because its exquisite green color was said to glow at night. This is perhaps because the stone exhibits double refraction, meaning that when looking through the stone, objects appear double. So when looking into a faceted peridot, the number of bottom facets appears to be double the actual number, creating a glittering sensation.\n\nPronounced PEAR-A-DOE, the word \u201cperidot\u201d comes from the French word meaning \u201cgem.\u201d It is the gem variety of the mineral olivine and ranks a 6.5-7.0 on the Mohs Scale.\n\nBorn in cauldrons of fire, peridot is considered the \u201cvolcanic gem,\u201d since small crystals of it are often found in the rocks created by volcanoes. In fact, Hawaiian legend called peridot the divine tears wept by Pele, goddess of the volcano. The island of Oahu even has beaches made out of olivine grains, but they are much too small to cut into peridot. Samples of the gem also have been discovered in meteorites that have fallen to Earth, many of which are more than a billion years old.\n\nPeridot traces its jewelry roots to 3,500 years ago. The stone was first mined by the ancient Egyptians on the volcanic island of Zebargad in the Red Sea. Known as the \u201cserpent isle,\u201d it was infested with poisonous snakes that interfered with mining activity until one Pharaoh had them all driven into the sea. Today, Native Americans mine most peridot on the San Carlos Reservation in Arizona. Interestingly, a lmost all peridot sold in Hawaii is from Arizona, despite the fact that peridot is produced by Hawaii's volcanoes. The gemstone is also found in Norway, Brazil, China, Egypt, Italy, Myanmar and Sri Lanka. An exciting new deposit was discovered in Pakistan in 1994, yielding some of the finest peridot ever seen, including one stone that weighed more than 300.00ct.\n\nPeridot is among the oldest known stones and has been mined as a gem for thousands of years. As early as 1575 to 1350 B.C., the ancient Egyptians used peridot beads in their ceremonial jewelry. In fact, it is believed the stone was one of the favorite gems of Cleopatra and that some of the \u201cemeralds\u201d she wore were actually peridot.\n\nAncient Egyptians also carved small drinking vessels out of large chunks of peridot. Priests would drink soma from them in rituals, believing the soma would put them in touch with the nature goddess, Isis. Legend has it that King Soloman traded cedar trees from Lebanon for 12 soma drinking cups and 144 liters of soma. The Egyptians made this trade for ramp logs to build their pyramids at Gisa, while King Soloman was said to have been enlightened by drinking soma from the peridot cups. Today, Mexican hill tribes still drink soma from green glazed cups to put them in touch with nature and their ancestors\u2019 spirits. Additionally, some Native American Indians in Arizona use tea made from peyote ground with peridot crystals in their rituals.\n\nPeridot has also been important to other cultures throughout history. Late in the Ottoman Empire (1300 to 1900), peridot was a highly prized gem and Turkish Sultans amassed some of the world\u2019s largest collections of the gemstone. It is mentioned in the Bible under the name of \u201cchrysolite,\u201d and was used to decorate medieval churches with samples that were most likely carried back to Europe by the Crusaders. Large stones weighing more than 200.00ct adorn the Shrine of the Three Magi at the Cologne Cathedral in Germany.\n\nThroughout the ages, peridot has been believed to hold mystical powers of protection and healing. The ancients regarded the stone as a symbol of the sun and wore it in amulets to prevent nightmares and drive away evil spirits. It was even favored by pirates to protect them against evil. Peridot was said to be useful for calming raging angers, curing nervous afflictions and promoting quiet sleep. It was also believed to strengthen any medicine drunk from goblets carved from the stone. South American Shamans used peridot to ward off snakebites and the evil spirits who have taken the form of mosquitoes who bring the sleeping sickness. They also say the heating of magic mushroom tea by peridot takes them on trips to the ancestor heavens.\n\nToday, peridot is believed to bring the wearer success, peace and good luck. To be most powerful, it is said that the stone should be mounted in gold and surrounded with small diamonds. With powers that are thought to bring protection and health, modern folklore also says it can be used to attract love and calm anger while soothing nerves and dispelling negative emotions. T he gem is believed to protect the wearer from bad dreams when set in gold.\n\nPeridot is considered the birthstone of August. Given as a symbol of fame, dignity and protection, this gem is also traditionally given to couples celebrating their 16 th wedding anniversaries.\n\nPalladium:\nA selection of our jewelry is made of sterling palladium alloy. Palladium is a member of the platinum group of precious metals. By replacing a portion of the copper content used in standard sterling silver with palladium, this proprietary formula renders a precious metal with superior performance attributes. Sterling palladium is five times more tarnish-resistant than standard sterling silver and has strength similar to that of 14K gold.\n\nPalladium has been used as a precious metal in jewelry since 1939, originally as an alternative to platinum for making white gold. Its naturally white color requires no rhodium plating. Additionally, palladium is proportionally much lighter than platinum and is ideal for use in heavier gemstone jewelry. It is a more expensive alloy than nickel, but it seldom causes the allergic reactions that nickel alloy can.\n\nStore your plated jewelry in a jewelry box lined with felt or anti-tarnish material. Items should not be stacked as this may cause damage to the plating surface.\n\nDo not use excessive pressure when cleaning with a polishing cloth or soft brush, as this may cause damage to the plating.\n\nOver time your plated items will need to be re-plated.

In fact, Hawaiian legend called peridot the divine tears wept by Pele, goddess of the volcano. The island of Oahu even has beaches made out of olivine grains, but they are much too small to cut into peridot. Samples of the gem also have been discovered in meteorites that have fallen to Earth, many of which are more than a billion years old.\n\nPeridot traces its jewelry roots to 3,500 years ago. The stone was first mined by the ancient Egyptians on the volcanic island of Zebargad in the Red Sea. Known as the \u201cserpent isle,\u201d it was infested with poisonous snakes that interfered with mining activity until one Pharaoh had them all driven into the sea. Today, Native Americans mine most peridot on the San Carlos Reservation in Arizona. Interestingly, a lmost all peridot sold in Hawaii is from Arizona, despite the fact that peridot is produced by Hawaii's volcanoes. The gemstone is also found in Norway, Brazil, China, Egypt, Italy, Myanmar and Sri Lanka. An exciting new deposit was discovered in Pakistan in 1994, yielding some of the finest peridot ever seen, including one stone that weighed more than 300.00ct.\n\nPeridot is among the oldest known stones and has been mined as a gem for thousands of years. As early as 1575 to 1350 B.C., the ancient Egyptians used peridot beads in their ceremonial jewelry. In fact, it is believed the stone was one of the favorite gems of Cleopatra and that some of the \u201cemeralds\u201d she wore were actually peridot.\n\nAncient Egyptians also carved small drinking vessels out of large chunks of peridot. Priests would drink soma from them in rituals, believing the soma would put them in touch with the nature goddess, Isis. Legend has it that King Soloman traded cedar trees from Lebanon for 12 soma drinking cups and 144 liters of soma. The Egyptians made this trade for ramp logs to build their pyramids at Gisa, while King Soloman was said to have been enlightened by drinking soma from the peridot cups. Today, Mexican hill tribes still drink soma from green glazed cups to put them in touch with nature and their ancestors\u2019 spirits. Additionally, some Native American Indians in Arizona use tea made from peyote ground with peridot crystals in their rituals.\n\nPeridot has also been important to other cultures throughout history. Late in the Ottoman Empire (1300 to 1900), peridot was a highly prized gem and Turkish Sultans amassed some of the world\u2019s largest collections of the gemstone. It is mentioned in the Bible under the name of \u201cchrysolite,\u201d and was used to decorate medieval churches with samples that were most likely carried back to Europe by the Crusaders. Large stones weighing more than 200.00ct adorn the Shrine of the Three Magi at the Cologne Cathedral in Germany.\n\nThroughout the ages, peridot has been believed to hold mystical powers of protection and healing. The ancients regarded the stone as a symbol of the sun and wore it in amulets to prevent nightmares and drive away evil spirits. It was even favored by pirates to protect them against evil. Peridot was said to be useful for calming raging angers, curing nervous afflictions and promoting quiet sleep. It was also believed to strengthen any medicine drunk from goblets carved from the stone. South American Shamans used peridot to ward off snakebites and the evil spirits who have taken the form of mosquitoes who bring the sleeping sickness. They also say the heating of magic mushroom tea by peridot takes them on trips to the ancestor heavens.\n\nToday, peridot is believed to bring the wearer success, peace and good luck. To be most powerful, it is said that the stone should be mounted in gold and surrounded with small diamonds. With powers that are thought to bring protection and health, modern folklore also says it can be used to attract love and calm anger while soothing nerves and dispelling negative emotions. T he gem is believed to protect the wearer from bad dreams when set in gold.\n\nPeridot is considered the birthstone of August. Given as a symbol of fame, dignity and protection, this gem is also traditionally given to couples celebrating their 16 th wedding anniversaries.\n\nPalladium:\nA selection of our jewelry is made of sterling palladium alloy. Palladium is a member of the platinum group of precious metals. By replacing a portion of the copper content used in standard sterling silver with palladium, this proprietary formula renders a precious metal with superior performance attributes. Sterling palladium is five times more tarnish-resistant than standard sterling silver and has strength similar to that of 14K gold.\n\nPalladium has been used as a precious metal in jewelry since 1939, originally as an alternative to platinum for making white gold. Its naturally white color requires no rhodium plating. Additionally, palladium is proportionally much lighter than platinum and is ideal for use in heavier gemstone jewelry. It is a more expensive alloy than nickel, but it seldom causes the allergic reactions that nickel alloy can.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "Pile-CC"}}

The culprits for the drop appear to be its weaker-than-expected third-quarter operating results and rumblings about a large acquisition.\n\nSo what\n\nThe clearest issue for GlaxoSmithKline, which is more commonly known as GSK, was its disappointing third-quarter results. On a constant currency basis, pharmaceutical sales inched higher by just 2%, vaccine sales were flat, and consumer healthcare grew by a steady 2%. That's an overall increase in sales of just 2%, with sales in Europe actually declining. The company cited strong growth in new products, but pointed to divestments and generic competition to mature drugs as the culprit for its pedestrian sales growth in pharma. Comparably, GSK's revenue was pretty much right in line with Wall Street's expectations.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nUnfortunately, the company's bottom-line missed by about 20%, with adjusted operating profit increasing by 5% on a constant currency basis, and adjusted EPS flat year-over-year. The finger-pointing mostly goes to an 11% hike in research and development costs, and a 3% increase to its cost of sales.\n\nIn addition to its disappointing earnings report, GSK also announced that it's considering a bid for Pfizer's (NYSE: PFE) consumer-health unit. The deal, which could be worth more than $10 billion if it were to become a reality, would expand GSK's consumer-health offerings, which generally provide modest growth and solid pricing power. However, a deal of this magnitude could put GlaxoSmithKline's superior 5% yield at risk, according to some pundits on Wall Street. GSK's dividend is arguably the greatest lure of owning this stock, so a cut would be concerning.\n\nNow what\n\nI'd have to admit that buying Pfizer's consumer-health division would be a bit perplexing considering that GSK completed a major reorganization back in 2015. In a three-part asset swap with Novartis, GlaxoSmithKline wound up jettisoning its oncology division, bolstering its vaccines segment, and forging a consumer-health joint venture with Novartis, all while collecting billions in additional cash from Novartis as a result of the deal. Though GSK generates more than half of its sales from pharmaceuticals, and investors are typically fans of balance with regard to operating segment contributions as a percentage of sales, bringing a slow-growth segment like Pfizer's consumer-health division into the fold is a head-scratcher.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nIf there is a bright spot here, GSK's next-generation respirator and HIV products are on fire. Breo Ellipta delivered 43% constant currency growth, along with 57% sales growth from Anoro Ellipta, while GSK's HIV therapies, Tivicay and Triumeq, also saw respective quarterly sales growth of 41% and 29% from the prior-year period.\n\nAt just a tad over 12 times forward earnings, and sporting a superior dividend, GSK has all the hallmarks of an income stock that could provide benefits to long-term investors. While not without risks, especially if GSK struggles to find its new identity following its reorganization, the company's respiratory and HIV segments appear to be on track. That's enough for me to suggest value and income investors take a closer look at GlaxoSmithKline.\n\n10 stocks we like better than GlaxoSmithKlineWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*\n\nDavid and Tom just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now... and GlaxoSmithKline wasn't one of them!

But for a builder, whose average monthly income is 200 euros, this sum is barely affordable.\n\nThe government can cover around 16% of the money required. That would be enough only for an outdated artificial arm with limited functions.\n\nInstead, government support is largely confined to providing the wounded with free medical care.\n\nExpensive prostheses are not part of the budget, says Nataliya Yusupova, a volunteer from Kiev helping to raise money for Serhiy and other injured soldiers.\n\nHundreds of thousands of euros have passed through her hands in the past few months, she says, mostly donations from ordinary Ukrainians.\n\n\"It is Ukrainians who provide clothes and medical treatment for our soldiers, as well as raise funds for prostheses,\" she says.\n\n\"So far I haven't witnessed a single case when the government would pay [for an up-to-date prosthesis]. They are young boys. They don't want just a stick to move around. They want to feel like normal.\"\n\nimage copyright EPA image caption Wounded Ukrainian soldiers were taken to Germany in early September for treatment in four military hospitals\n\nThe state budget is exhausted by the war in the east, but it is not the only obstacle to proper care for the wounded, volunteers say.\n\n'Circles of hell'\n\nTwo of the other biggest problems are corruption and red tape.\n\nOleksandr Morozov from the Rehabilitation Centre of Afghan War Veterans, is particularly critical of the level of corruption still endemic in Ukraine.\n\n\"We can say that we have weeded out all those who made our lives fall apart, but it's not really true,\" he says.\n\nTo get money from the state, an injured soldier like Serhiy has to endure \"all the circles of bureaucratic hell\", says Oleksiy Krasnoshchokov, from Ukrainian volunteer network pidmoga.info . He has used prosthetic limbs for years.\n\nWithout Serhiy collecting hard copies of documents from various institutions, the government will not pay 16% of the cost, about 3,000 euros.\n\nHe needs to get hold of documents to prove\n\nhe was a soldier\n\nhe was wounded\n\nhe requires a particular kind of prosthesis\n\nand he needs to come up with excerpts from relevant military orders\n\nUkraine's ministry of social policy told the BBC in a statement that all its procedures were according to the law.\n\n\"The disabled receive rehabilitation devices upon submitting an individual application, and the state gives money to buy these devices,\" the statement said.\n\nBut activists find this explanation hard to believe.\n\nSerhiy Hordiychuk himself is reluctant to talk about what has happened to him and about the documents he needs to receive his government funding.\n\nWhen asked how he feels about the government, which first sent him to the war and now will not pay for his lost arm, Serhiy says: \"What can I say? It looks like no-one is to blame.\"\n\nPausing for a moment, he then explains: \"Honestly I have never relied too much on the government. I just take it as it comes.\"", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "Translate\n\nSunday, January 6, 2019\n\nSummer, Glorious Summer!\n\nMy garden looks its best in the Summer. A lot of the plants I\u2019ve selected for colour seem to be the ones that flower in summer, which is great because that\u2019s when the garden gets the most use. The most obvious of these flowering plants would have to be the Bougainvillea Vine which I\u2019ve trained to grow over a pergola. It\u2019s a really nice place to sit as it provides a bit of shade from the harsh New Zealand sun.\n\nThe garden has changed quite a bit as it\u2019s matured over the last few years, so I realised it was time to update the header on my Blog. I\u2019ve been waiting for the Bougainvillea to be in full bloom so I could get a few nice photos. The header photo I decided to use was a panorama shot I took from the roof of the sleepout. This year the pergola was a great place to take a few family photos too.\n\nOne of the plants I\u2019ve really enjoyed this year would have to be the Hydrangeas. I\u2019ve tried propagating a few over the last couple of years from cuttings and was pleased to see them flowering nicely this year (year 2). The most interesting aspect of this for me was seeing how the colours varied from the original plants I took the cuttings from, as the variations in soil acidity resulted in different coloured blooms. And what blooms they were after giving them a good feed in spring. They make terrific cut flowers too.\n\nWe\u2019ve been spoilt this year with the number of cut flowers we\u2019ve been able to take in the house.\n\nLike these red beauties (which I forget the name of), plus a few others which I forgot to take photos of...\n\nThe big disappointment this summer was that despite my 2 plum trees fruiting super-abundantly, beyond expectations, the fruit was mostly spoiled by an infestation of worms and several days of torrential rain just as the fruit was ripening which caused them to split. I can see I\u2019m going to have to be super vigilant next year and may need to relent as regards my organic, \u2018no-spray\u2019 policy.\n\nSponsored Links\n\nAbout Me\n\nI'm from Auckland, New Zealand. I'm a graphic designer, web developer and print management consultant by profession. I started off as a printer having served a printing apprenticeship back in the early '80's but quickly moved into design, advertising and marketing and have been in the industry now for more than 30 years helping businesses to promote themselves and their products and services.\n\nI have many interests besides this including gardening, fishing, photography, DIY and spending time with my family and friends. I also enjoy reading and discussing the bible.\n\nIf you wish to discuss any of the above, feel free to contact me or make a comment on any one of my posts and I'll respond as soon as I can.

A comparative study within subjects was done in nine healthy volunteers, 5 female and 4 male, aged 23 to 39 years. The dose for both radiopharmaceuticals was 740 MBq; radiopharmacokinetic parameters were determined and a whole body bone scan was taken with a MultiSpect 2 gamma camera two hours post administration with a wash-out period of 72 hours between preparations. The images were independently evaluated by three nuclear medicine physicians by drawing of regions of interest (ROIs) on vertebrae, ribs, femur, sternum, joints and skull. Ratios bone/soft tissue were obtained drawing ROIs on several bones. The kappa test and the Wilcoxon rank test were used for statistical comparisons. The agreement on the quality of the images with Tc-ABP and Tc-MDP was fair (kappa 0.4). The femur/soft tissue ratio had a normal distribution and the Wilcoxon test showed no statistical difference between preparations. Even though bone uptake was higher and faster with Tc-ABP, the quality of the scans obtained with either radiopharmaceutical was similar. We recommend the use of Tc-ABP as a routine bone scan agent because of its less radiation exposure to the patient.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "PubMed Abstracts"}}

{"text": "In order to explain the background of the present invention in detail, reference will be made to FIG. 1, which shows a circuit diagram of a prior art semiconductor memory device. There are provided enhancement type MOS field-eeffect transistors 1,2,3 and 4, hereinafter referred to as MOSFETs. The drains of the P-channel MOSFET 1 and N-channel MOSFET 2 are connected to each other, and the gates thereof are connected to each other. The source of the MOSFET 1 is connected to a power supply terminal 5, and that of the MOSFET 2 is connected to ground, thus constituting a complementary MOS (hereinafter referred to as CMOS) inverter 30a. Likewise, the P-channel MOSFET 3 and the N-channel MOSFET 4 constitute a CMOS inverter 30b. With these two inverters 30a and 30b a bistable circuit, that is, a flip-flop, is formed. More particularly, the outputs of the two inverters 30a and 30b are connected to the inputs of the mating inverters 30b and 30a. In other words, the drains of the P-channel MOSFETs 1 and 3, and of the N-channel MOSFETs 2 and 4 are connected to the gates of the N-channel MOSFETs 4 and 2, and of the P-channel MOSFETs 3 and 1, respectively. In this way a one bit memory cell 30 is constructed.\nThe N-channel MOSFETs 6 and 7 which are used for transfer gates to control the writing-in and the reading-out operation, have drains (or sources) connected to the drain of the MOSFETs 1 and 2, and that of the MOSFETs 3 and 4, respectively, and have sources (or drains) connected to bit lines 8 and 9 respectively, which function as information lines for writing-in as well as reading-out. The gates of the N-channel MOSFETs 6 and 7 are connected to a word line 10 which functions as a selector line for writing-in as well as reading-out.\nThe sources and gates of the N-channel MOSFETs 11 and 12 are connected to power supply terminals 5, and their drains are connected to the bit lines 8 and 9. An information input signal line 13 is connected to the gates of the P-channel MOSFET 14 and N-channel MOSFET 15, which constitute a writing-in circuit 40. In addition, the information input signal line 13 is connected to the drain (or source) of the N-channel MOSFET 16, which is used for a gate to control the information to be written in. The source (or drain) of the MOSFET 16 is connected to the bit line 9, and its gate is connected to a writing-in control signal line 17 which is designed to control the writing operation of the memory cell 30. The drains of the MOSFETs 14 and 15 are connected to the drain (or source) of the N-channel MOSFET 18, which is used for a gate to control the data to be written in. The source (or drain) of the N-channel MOSFET 18 is connected to the bit line 8, and its gate is connected to the writing-in control signal line 17. In this way the MOSFETs 16 and 18 can transmit the output from the writing-in circuit 40 to the bit lines 8 and 9 through between the drain and source thereof.\nIn operation, the memory cells 30 and the MOSFETs 6, 7 are arrayed in matrix in plurality. A desired memory cell is directly selected by the random access method, in or from which memory cell the data is written or read out. While the memory cell stores data, the word line 10 is kept at almost zero voltage, thereby turning off the MOSFETs 6 and 7. The memory cell 30 constituted by the MOSFETs 1, 2, 3 and 4 is electrically separated from the bit lines 8 and 9. The memory cell 30 is in one of two stable states when the gates of the MOSFETs 1 and 2 are kept \"L\" (low). At this time the MOSFET 1 is in ON state with its drain being kept \"H\" (high). Accordingly, the gates of the MOSFETs 3 and 4 become \"H\", thereby turning on the MOSFET 4 with placing its drain \"L\".\nWhen the memory cell 30 is in this stable state, information can be written therein by applying voltage corresponding to the information to the bit lines 8 and 9, and applying the voltage \"H\" to the word line 10 so as to address the memory cell 30.\nNow, suppose that the logic \"1\" is to be written in the memory cell 30. The voltage \"H\" is applied to the writing-in control signal line 17, thereby turning on the MOSFETs 16 and 18, and the voltage \"H\" corresponding to the logic \"1\" is applied to the information input signal line 13. In this way the bit line 9 is kept \"H\" through the MOSFET 16. In addition, the gates of the MOSFETs 14 and 15 are kept \"H\", thereby turning off the MOSFET 14 and turning on the MOSFET 15. Thus the drains of the MOSFETs 14 and 15 become \"L\", thereby placing the bit line 8 \"L\" through the MOSFET 18.\nAt this stage, when the word line 10 is placed \"H\", the MOSFETs 6 and 7 are turned on, thereby enabling the potentials in tne bit 1ines 8 and 9 to be impressed on the memory cell 30. As a result, the MOSFET 1 is turned off whereas the MOSFET 2 is turned on, thereby reversing the states of the MOSFETs 1, 2, and 3, 4. In this way the memory cell 30 enter into the other stable state which means storing the information \"1\". Subsequently, the word line 10 and the writing-in control signal line 17 are returned to \"L\". With this, the writing operation ends.\nWhen information is to be read out from the memory cell 30, voltage of the same amplitude as that applied while writing-in operation, is impressed on the word line 10, thereby turning on the MOSFETs 6 and 7. This ensures that the electric charges stored in the bit lines 8 and 9 through the MOSFETs 11 and 12 are absorbed by the information stored in the memory cell 30, whereby a potential difference is given to between the bit lines 8 and 9 in accordance with the information stored in the memory cell 30. In this way the stored information is transmitted to the bit lines 8 and 9, and thereafter it is amplified as by a sense amplifier, and is output to the outside.\nWhen this reading operation is to be performed, it is the common practice to charge up the bit lines 8, 9 previously up to the \"H\" voltage through the MOSFETs 11, 12. This is important in preventing an erroneous writing of the information in the bit lines onto the memory cell, which is likely to occur when the MOSFETs 6, 7 are turned on in a situation where the bit lines having a large parasitic capacity have information opposite to that stored in the memory cell.\nUnder the prior art semiconductor memory device mentioned above, the bit lines are constantly charged in spite of the fact that the charging-up is required only when a reading-out operation is to be performed. As a result, the writing information and the electric charges in the bit lines come into collision when information is to be written in. This increases the consumption of electricity, and slows down the operational speeds.\nOne of prior art methods of controlling the writing and the reading operation is a technique disclosed in the article entitled \"A 4K Static 5V RAM\" by Jeffrey M. Schlageter, Nagab Jayakumar, Joseph H. Kroeger and Vahe Sarkissian, which was prepared for the 1976 International Solid-State Circuit Conference. The article teaches that by disabling the Chip Enable signal, the bit and data lines are equalized to an intermediate voltage of the power supply voltage.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "USPTO Backgrounds"}}
{"text": "\n21 P.3d 924 (2001)\n135 Idaho 602\nThomas Dale RAUDEBAUGH, Petitioner-Appellant,\nv.\nSTATE of Idaho, Respondent.\nNo. 26946.\nSupreme Court of Idaho, Boise, January 2001 Term.\nApril 2, 2001.\n*925 Ronaldo A. Coulter, State Appellate Public Defender, Boise, for appellant. Molly J. Huskey argued.\nAlan G. Lance, Attorney General, Boise, for respondent. T. Paul Krueger, II, argued.\nSCHROEDER, Justice.\nThomas Raudebaugh (Raudebaugh) appeals the district court's order dismissing his second amended petition for post-conviction relief. The Court of Appeals affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded the case for further proceedings. This matter is before this Court upon the state's petition for review of the Court of Appeals decision.\n\nI.\n\nBACKGROUND AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS\nRaudebaugh was convicted of second degree murder and sentenced to a unified life sentence with ten years fixed, followed by a weapons enhancement of five years, to run consecutively. He appealed the conviction, alleging several errors by the trial court including: erroneous jury instructions, the erroneous admission of both expert and lay testimony, and prosecutorial misconduct in closing argument. This Court affirmed the district court. See State v. Raudebaugh, 124 Idaho 758, 864 P.2d 596 (1993).\nRaudebaugh filed a petition for post-conviction relief and a first amended petition for post-conviction relief. He then filed a motion for production of evidence, including a knife, which was the murder weapon, a pipe, and his fingerprint exemplar. Raudebaugh sought to have the evidence released and examined by an independent expert to determine whether additional fingerprints could be identified on the knife after the state's expert found none. The district court denied the discovery request \"without prejudice subject to review at a future time.\" Raudebaugh then filed a second amended petition. The state moved to dismiss the petition pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 19-4906(b) and (c). The district court granted the state's motion. Raudebaugh appealed the district court's order.\nThe Court of Appeals affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded the case for further proceedings. The Court of Appeals determined that the district court erred in denying the discovery request and remanded the case to the district court to render a decision applying what the Court of Appeals stated was a new standard for discovery requests in post-conviction relief proceedings. Although the Court of Appeals found error in the district court's order regarding Raudebaugh's prosecutorial misconduct allegations, the court affirmed that portion of the decision on different grounds. The state filed a timely petition for review which this Court granted.\n\nII.\n\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\nWhen considering a case on review from the Court of Appeals, this Court gives serious consideration to the Court of Appeals; however, this Court reviews the decision of the trial court directly. State v. Avelar, 129 Idaho 700, 702, 931 P.2d 1218, 1220 (1997). This Court is not merely reviewing the correctness of the Court of Appeals' decision; rather, this Court is hearing the matter as if the case were on direct appeal from the trial judge's decision. See Stanley v. McDaniel, 134 Idaho 630, 7 P.3d 1107 (2000); State v. Weaver, 127 Idaho 288, 290, 900 P.2d 196, 198 (1995). In Sato v. Schossberger 117 Idaho 771, 775, 792 P.2d 336, 340 *926 (1990), this Court set forth the standard of review:\nIf we decide to review a decision of the Court of Appeals, we ordinarily consider all the issues presented to the Court of Appeals. Occasionally, we may decide to address less than all of the issues presented to the Court of Appeals. In that case, we advise the parties of the issues we will address. As to the issues we decide to address, we consider that we are hearing the matter in the first instance, not merely considering the correctness of the decision of the Court of Appeals. If the issues presented to the Court of Appeals concerned a decision of a district court, we consider the correctness of the district court's decision. While we value the opinion of the Court of Appeals for the insight it gives us in addressing the issues presented on appeal, we do not focus on the opinion of the Court of Appeals, but rather on the decision of the district court.\nId., see also McDaniel, 134 Idaho at 632, 7 P.3d at 1109 (2000); and Eagle Water Company, Inc., v. Roundy Pole Fence Company, Inc, 134 Idaho 626, 7 P.3d 1103 (2000).\nIn determining whether a motion for summary disposition is properly granted under I.C. 19-4906, the Court reviews the facts in a light most favorable to the petitioner and determines whether the facts would entitle petitioner to relief if accepted as true. Saykhamchone v. State, 127 Idaho 319, 321, 900 P.2d 795, 797 (1995). A petition for post-conviction relief is subject to summary dismissal if the petitioner has not presented evidence establishing a prima facie case as to each element of the claims upon which the applicant bears the burden of proof. See Pratt v. State, 134 Idaho 581, 583, 6 P.3d 831, 833 (2000) (citing Berg v. State, 131 Idaho 517, 518-19, 960 P.2d 738, 739-40 (1998)).\nA petition for post-conviction relief based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel will survive a motion for summary dismissal if the petitioner establishes: (1) a material issue of fact exists as to whether counsel's performance was deficient; and (2) a material issue of fact exists as to whether the deficiency prejudiced petitioner's case. Pratt, 134 Idaho at 583, 6 P.3d at 833 (citing Saykhamchone, 127 Idaho at 323, 900 P.2d at 799).\n\nIII.\n\nTHE DISTRICT COURT DID NOT ERR IN DISMISSING THE PETITION FOR POST-CONVICTION RELIEF ON THE GROUNDS THAT RAUDEBAUGH FAILED TO SUFFICIENTLY ALLEGE TRIAL COUNSEL'S PERFORMANCE WAS PREJUDICIAL.\nRaudebaugh argues that his trial counsel's performance was deficient and the deficiencies had a prejudicial effect on the outcome of his trial. To support his claim Raudebaugh sought release of the knife that was used as the murder weapon for examination by an expert witness to determine if there was fingerprint evidence that could have assisted him at trial. Raudebaugh admitted striking the victim with a pipe, which had his fingerprints, but denied stabbing the victim. His fingerprints were not found on the knife.\nRaudebaugh requested additional time to amend the petition so that an expert could review the evidence and file an affidavit addressing what could have been testified to at trial. Raudebaugh complains that the district court refused to release the evidence but informed him that the issue could be raised later when in fact the district court dismissed the petition without again ruling on the motion for discovery. Consequently, Raudebaugh maintains that he was deprived of the opportunity to show prejudice from the alleged deficiency of his trial attorney's conduct of the case.\nThe district court did not finally adjudicate that trial counsel's performance was deficient, but did determine that the affidavits provided by Raudebaugh alleged a sufficient factual basis that trial counsel's representation was deficient so that summary disposition would be inappropriate on the first part of the Strickland test. However, the district court found that the affidavits and petition failed to set forth facts to establish that trial counsel's performance was prejudicial to the *927 outcome of the trial, because Raudebaugh made only conclusory and speculative assertions as to what testimony an independent investigator or expert witness might have provided at trial. Consequently, the district court granted the state's motion for summary disposition on this issue.\nRaudebaugh claims that the district court erred in determining that he had not provided sufficient evidence to show the prejudicial effects of trial counsel's performance. He maintains that the district court erred by failing to release the murder weapon so that experts could examine it before dismissing the petition because without the requested evidence he was unable to make a showing of prejudice.\nDiscovery in post-conviction proceedings is allowed only with authorization by the court pursuant to I.C.R 57(b), which states in relevant part:\n... the provisions for discovery in the Idaho Rules of Civil Procedure shall not apply to the proceedings unless and only to the extent ordered by the trial court.\nI.C.R. 57(b). The decision to authorize discovery during post-conviction relief is a matter left to the sound discretion of the district court. See Fairchild v. State, 128 Idaho 311, 319, 912 P.2d 679, 687 (Ct.App.1996) (citing Griffith v. State, 121 Idaho 371, 375, 825 P.2d 94, 98 (Ct.App.1992)). Unless discovery is necessary to protect an applicant's substantial rights, the district court is not required to order discovery. Id.\nThe district court reserved ruling on the discovery motion until Raudebaugh filed his second amended petition to see if the petition alleged prejudice. After the second amended petition was filed, the district court determined that the petition and affidavits failed to provide evidence that trial counsel's performance was prejudicial. The petition makes conclusory statements about what an expert and investigator might have testified at trial but does not point to specific facts. The affidavits are primarily concerned with the deficiency of trial counsel's performance, not with the prejudicial effects of the deficient performance.\nRaudebaugh argues that once the district court found that trial counsel's conduct was deficient, discovery should have been authorized in the post-conviction action to permit scientific examination or testing without requiring that the post-conviction applicant also show any probability that the independent examination will yield exculpatory evidence. The Court of Appeals accepted Raudebaugh's position. However, this Court rejects that position in this case.\nGranting discovery is left to the discretion of the trial court. The test is whether the district court abused its discretion by summarily dismissing the petition without ruling specifically on the discovery request. The district court intended for Raudebaugh to make a showing of prejudice in the second amended petition and concluded that Raudebaugh failed to provide evidence of prejudice sufficient to defeat summary dismissal. The district court's conclusion is based on the fact that Raudebaugh's allegations only argue what the experts might have testified to had trial counsel employed them. Raudebaugh's allegations are speculative. There is no showing that the state's testing was flawed or that there is new technology that would make current testing more reliable. The district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the case without authorizing the requested discovery.\n\nIV.\n\nRAUDEBAUGH WAS NOT PRECLUDED FROM RAISING CERTAIN ISSUES OF PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT IN POST-CONVICTION RELIEF PROCEEDINGS, BUT ANY ERROR WAS HARMLESS.\nRaudebaugh's petition for post-conviction relief cites four claims of prosecutorial misconduct: 1) the prosecutor coached the finger print expert in what to write in his report; 2) the prosecutor failed to disclose the reports of the state's finger print expert, a phone directory seized from the crime scene, and two officers as expert witnesses; 3) the prosecutor's opening statement made claims unsupported in the record; 4) the *928 prosecutor failed to disclose one of the detective's reports.\nIn his direct appeal Raudebaugh contested statements by the prosecuting attorney during his closing argument relating to the burden of proof and the manner of the victim's death. The district court found Raudebaugh's claims of prosecutorial misconduct were sufficiently related to the issues raised on direct appeal that they should have been raised on direct appeal. Consequently, the failure to raise them in the direct appeal resulted in their forfeiture.\nPost-conviction petitions are not substitutes for appeals. It is well established that applicants for post-conviction relief are not allowed to raise issues in post-conviction proceedings that could have been raised on direct appeal unless the issues were not known and could not reasonably have been known during the direct appeal. I.C. \u00a7 19-4901(b); Hollon v. State, 132 Idaho 573, 581, 976 P.2d 927, 935 (1999); Rodgers v. State, 129 Idaho 720, 932 P.2d 348 (1997). Idaho Code section 19-4901(b) states:\n(b) This remedy is not a substitute for nor does it affect any remedy incident to the proceedings in the trial court, or of an appeal from the sentence or conviction. Any issue which could have been raised on direct appeal, but was not, is forfeited and may not be considered in post conviction proceedings unless it appears to the court, on the basis of a substantial factual showing by affidavit, disposition or otherwise, that the asserted basis for relief raises a substantial doubt about the reliability of the finding of guilt and could not, in the exercise of due diligence, have been presented earlier.\nI.C. \u00a7 19-4901(b).\nRaudebaugh concedes that his claims regarding the opening statement and the disclosure of experts could have been addressed on direct appeal. However, he contests the district court's finding that the other claims raised in the petition for post-conviction relief are sufficiently related to those raised in the direct appeal such that they should have been raised in the direct appeal.\nThe state concedes that the district court erred in summarily dismissing the remaining claims without first determining whether the evidence was known at the time of the direct appeal. However, the state argues that regardless of its reasoning, the district court properly dismissed the claims because Raudebaugh failed to establish that a genuine issue of material fact exists regarding this issue, contending that Raudebaugh failed to show how the alleged misconduct amounted to prejudice or reversible error.\nRaudebaugh's claims are based on three documents that allegedly were not disclosed to the defense during the criminal proceedings: a handwritten list of telephone numbers found at the crime scene, a report by a police officer referring to a missed appointment, and a letter written by the prosecutor to the State's fingerprint analyst. The first two documents are not exculpatory on their face, and Raudebaugh has given no explanation as to how they could have been useful to the defense. With respect to the third item, Raudebaugh contends that the prosecutor's letter to the fingerprint expert shows that the prosecutor impermissibly coached the expert about what to include in a supplemental report. However, when the letter is examined together with the fingerprint expert's initial report, it is apparent that the prosecutor sought clarification of ambiguities in the first report and was not suggesting any alteration of the expert's findings or shading of the expert's testimony. The letter contains nothing favorable to the defense and does not meet the standard of materiality. Raudebaugh has not demonstrated how the nondisclosure of these documents could have altered the outcome of his trial. The district court's dismissal of the claims of prosecutorial misconduct was proper.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe decision of the district court dismissing Raudebaugh's petition for post-conviction relief is affirmed.\nTROUT, C.J., WALTERS, KIDWELL and EISMANN, JJ., concur.\n", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "FreeLaw"}}

Another compli cation gaining significance\nin the life of present-day nomads is the time-zone\nindication as implemented in the Calatrava Travel Time \u2013\nit simultaneously displays the local time in two different\nzones. This watch is available in a ladies\u2019 version. Patek\nPhilippe\u2019s World Time watch goes a step further and displays\nall 24 time zones at the same time. It is based on a\nprinciple devised by the ingenious Genevan watchmaker\nLouis Cottier in the 1930s and perfected and patented by\nPatek Philippe in 1999. The mechanism makes it possible\nfor the wearer to switch the watch easily from one time\nzone to the next without compromising the rate accuracy\nof the movement. Meanwhile, the moon-phase display\nenjoys an enduring popularity. This poetic complication\nindicates the gradual day-to-day progression of the moon\u2019s\nface in a curved dial aperture. But the mechanism behind\nit is more sophisticated than meets the eye. It is so precise\nthat the display faithfully tracks the true lunation for\n122 years and 45 days. Only then must it be corrected by\none day. \u201cUseful\u201d compli cations also include different\ntypes of chronographs from classic manually wound chronographs\nwith column wheels to innovative self-winding\nAnnual Calendar chronographs with monocounter.\nAll these timepieces are crafted in Patek Philippe\u2019s ateliers\nin Geneva. Many of them are endowed with an Annual\nCalendar mechanism, a moon-phase display, or a powerreserve\nindication and they belong to a group of watches\nthat illustrates the subtle line between \u201cuseful\u201d complications\nand grand complications.\n\nGRAND COMPLICATIONS\n\nGrand complications represent the paragon of horology\nand challenge the watchmaker to the ultimate degree.\nThis apotheosis of haute horlogerie has been a part of the\nPatek Philippe heritage since the company was founded\nin 1839. No other watchmaker has been involved in\nthe highest sphere of horology for such a long time\nwithout interruption; no other company has created\nsuch an impressive portfolio of complicated watches.\nWith 33 complications, the Calibre 89 was the world\u2019s most\ncomplicated portable timepiece when it was presented in\n1989. Grand complications include intricate mechanisms\nsuch as the tourbillon, which compensates variations of\nthe center of gravity of balance springs in vertical positions,\nand the repeater function, which tells the time acoustically\nby striking gongs. Split-seconds chronographs also belong\nto this category, as do perpetual calendars and various\nastronomical indications including sunrise and sunset\ndisplays, and stellar progressions. All these mechanisms are\nhighly complex and correlated with one another in various\nways. Often, they are enriched with further refinements\nsuch as retrograde displays or instantaneous calendarswitching\nmechanisms. A Patek Philippe tourbillon consists\nof 31 parts, yet weighs a mere 0.3 grams. Patek Philippe\u2019s\nminute repeaters draw on a tradition established over\n150 years ago. Their sound as they strike the hours, quarter\nhours, and minutes is considered to be the benchmark\nof acoustic-time indication. Astronomical watches are\nanother domain in which Patek Philippe has shown\nunprecedented prowess. The Sky Moon Tourbillon is a\nprime example: it needs both sides of the watch to accommodate\nall of its features. But these grand complications\nare not spectacular, one-off showpieces.

{"text": "Since last year\u2019s election it\u2019s been clear that this Government, if it thought it could get away with it, was going to cave into the demands of dairy farmers and introduce badger culling to prevent the spread of bovine TB. This is despite the fact there\u2019s no scientific evidence that culls would be effective. In fact scientists have said that culling could make the problem worse by encouraging other badgers to move into the area vacated by the culled badgers.\n\nIf you agree, please sign up to the League Against Cruel Sport\u2019s petition \u2013 www.league.org.uk/badgerpetition\n\nMore badgers moving around = more disease. And experts also say it\u2019s the growth in cattle movements \u2013 where industrial-scale dairy farms now send cattle to all four quarters of the country for sale, rather than the traditional farming model of cows being sold at the local market \u2013 which is widely blamed for the increase in bovine TB, not the badgers. But of course the agribusinesses don\u2019t want any curbs on this market in cows.\n\nThe Government, perhaps unsure of public opinion, was wavering over whether or not to allow culling. At a recent Environment Food and Rural Affairs questions in Parliament I described the Government policy on badger culling as \u2018a complete shambles\u2019, which it was. Now it appears that the Government has finally made its mind up \u2013 although it wasn\u2019t planning on telling you until after the local elections. It\u2019s going to allow what the Minister for Farming (himself a dairy farmer) describes as \u201cfree shooting\u201d and the Guardian describes as \u201ca Big Society badger cull\u201d whereby anyone with a firearms licence will be allowed to go out and shoot badgers.\n\nAs the League Against Cruel Sports say, this will create a new bloodsport. Fox-hunting has been banned \u2013 although the vast majority of Tories would love to bring it back, if they could only win a vote in Parliament \u2013 but it will be open season on badgers. Anyone with a firearms licence will be able to roam the countryside looking for badgers to kill.\n\nBadgers are at the moment a protected species, and it\u2019s illegal to kill them. If the Government gets its way, they will lose this status and will be fair game for anyone with a firearms licence. Those wanting to shoot badgers will also have to apply for a specific licence under the Badger Protection Act, but the police in the National Wildlife Crime Unit has expressed sceptism about whether this will be much use in stopping people hunting badgers for sport: \u201d \u201cThere is a very real danger of illegal badger persecution being carried out under the pretext of culling activity.\u201d\n\nThose of us who are opposed to culling, both on scientific and humane grounds, believe that vaccination not extermination is the way to deal with bovine TB.\n\nIf we can get enough signatures we can stop the bloodshed before it starts.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}
{"text": "Q:\n\nHow to make python not to create/copy pyobject from boost::shared_ptr during iteration on std::vector via boost::python?\n\nI have an object and std::vector of boost::shared_ptr-s of that objects in it which I want to transfer into python using boost::python.\nThe problem here is the fact that during iteration over the exposed vector in python I'm getting different addresses every time for the same object.\nAs I understand, python creates pyobject via my boost::shared_ptr on every iteration and after the iteration (actually after the second iteration) garbage collector frees that address, though the elements are boost::shared_ptr-s.\nWhen the elements are in python's list, they have their unique addresses which are not changing during iterations. This is what I'm trying to achieve.\nI tried to surf the internet by reaching different boost documentations and different QAs in stackoverflow but failed to get my issue resolved.\nI've created a small example demonstrating this issue.\nHere is the C++ code:\n#include <vector>\n#include <boost/shared_ptr.hpp>\n#include <boost/make_shared.hpp>\n#include <boost/python.hpp>\n\nnamespace bp = boost::python;\n\nclass A {\n    public:\n        A() : m_int(0) { }\n        A(int numb) : m_int(numb) { }\n        int get_m() const { return m_int; }\n    private:\n        int m_int;\n};\n\nstd::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& out, const A& obj) {\n    out << obj.get_m();\n    return out;\n}\n\nusing APtr = boost::shared_ptr<A>;\nusing ACont = std::vector<APtr>;\nusing AContPtr = boost::shared_ptr<ACont>;\n\nAPtr CreateA() {\n    return boost::make_shared<A>();\n}\n\nAPtr CreateAFromNumb(int numb) {\n    return boost::make_shared<A>(numb);\n}\n\nAContPtr CreateEmptyACont() {\n    return boost::make_shared<ACont>();\n}\n\nAContPtr CreateFullACont(int size) {\n    ACont vec{};\n    for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {\n        vec.push_back(boost::make_shared<A>(i));\n    }\n    return boost::make_shared<ACont>(vec);\n}\n\nBOOST_PYTHON_MODULE(example) {\n    bp::class_<A, APtr, boost::noncopyable>(\"A\", bp::no_init)\n        .def(\"__init__\", bp::make_constructor(CreateA))\n        .def(\"__init__\", bp::make_constructor(CreateAFromNumb))\n        .def(bp::self_ns::str(bp::self))\n        ;\n    bp::register_ptr_to_python<APtr>();\n\n    bp::class_<ACont, AContPtr, boost::noncopyable>(\"ACont\", bp::no_init)\n        .def(\"__init__\", bp::make_constructor(CreateEmptyACont))\n        .def(\"__init__\", bp::make_constructor(CreateFullACont))\n        .def(\"__iter__\", bp::iterator<ACont>())\n        .def(\"__len__\", &ACont::size)\n        ;\n    bp::register_ptr_to_python<AContPtr>();\n}\n\nHere is the usage of it in python:\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nfrom example import *\n\nvec = ACont(4)\n\nprint len(vec)\nprint \"VEC\", vec\nfor x in vec:\n    print x,\n    print repr(x)\n\nprint \"VEC\", vec\nfor x in vec:\n    print x,\n    print repr(x)\n\nl = [x for x in vec]\n\nprint \"LIST\"\nfor x in l:\n    print x,\n    print repr(x)\nprint \"LIST\"\nfor x in l:\n    print x,\n    print repr(x)\n\nWhen iterating over the exposed std::vector/boost::shared_ptr<std::vector> I'm getting different addresses for the same elements during just two sequential iterations.\n\nPython creates pyobject on first iteration for the first item and\nshows it's address.\nOn the second iteration, python creates another pyobject for the second element on another address.\nGarbage collector sees that the first address is no more usable and frees it.\nOn the third iteration, python creates another pyobject for the third element in the same address as the first one, since gc just freed it.\nAnd so on.\n\nBut iteration over the list of the same elements is being done correctly, since python does not create/destruct pyobjects as they have references in the list itself.\nHere is the output of python run:\n4\nVEC <example.ACont object at 0x7ffff7ea9578>\n0 <example.A object at 0x7ffff7eb27d0>    # address 1\n1 <example.A object at 0x7ffff7eb2848>    # address 2\n2 <example.A object at 0x7ffff7eb27d0>    # address 1 since gc just have freed it\n3 <example.A object at 0x7ffff7eb2848>    # so on\nVEC <example.ACont object at 0x7ffff7ea9578>\n0 <example.A object at 0x7ffff7eb27d0>\n1 <example.A object at 0x7ffff7eb2848>\n2 <example.A object at 0x7ffff7eb27d0>\n3 <example.A object at 0x7ffff7eb2848>\nLIST\n0 <example.A object at 0x7ffff7eb27d0>    # address 1\n1 <example.A object at 0x7ffff7eb2848>    # address 2\n2 <example.A object at 0x7ffff7eb28c0>    # address 3\n3 <example.A object at 0x7ffff7eb2938>    # address 4\nLIST\n0 <example.A object at 0x7ffff7eb27d0>\n1 <example.A object at 0x7ffff7eb2848>\n2 <example.A object at 0x7ffff7eb28c0>\n3 <example.A object at 0x7ffff7eb2938>\n\nSummarizing, I would like to know whether there is a way not to create pyobjects in python for each element created in C++ taking into account a fact that these objects are boost::shared_ptr-s of some object.\nThank you in advance.\nP.S. I'm using boost version 1.60 and python 2.7 (anaconda package).\n\nA:\n\nSo, after long investigations, I found out that the task I wanted to solve does not have a real solution. This is due to the fact that python must register each object (created elsewhere, not in python) that just appeared in its environment to be aware of it. So the rest of scenario, regarding garbage collector, goes like described in the question. Neither boost/python nor swig could handle this case.\nBut, as a manual solution to this, to solve addressing issues I've created some kind of address mapping functionality. Since my issue was connected with object addresses, I transferred C++ address to python in order to see real object's address instead of python's one.\nAlso, since I need hashing functionality working on addresses, I did the same thing there. Here is my update\n// Same code as previously\nstd::string GetAddress(const APtr& a_ptr) {\n    std::string repr{\"<example.A object at \"};\n    std::stringstream sstream;\n    sstream << std::hex << std::showbase << reinterpret_cast<std::uintptr_t>(a_ptr.get());\n    repr += sstream.str() + \">\";\n    return repr;\n}\n\nstatic std::size_t Hash(const APtr& a_ptr) {\n    std::hash<std::uintptr_t> hasher;\n    return hasher(reinterpret_cast<std::uintptr_t>(a_ptr.get()));\n}\n\nBOOST_PYTHON_MODULE(example) {\n    bp::class_<A, APtr, boost::noncopyable>(\"A\", bp::no_init)\n        .def(\"__init__\", bp::make_constructor(CreateA))\n        .def(\"__init__\", bp::make_constructor(CreateAFromNumb))\n        .def(\"__repr__\", GetAddress)\n        .def(\"__hash__\", Hash)\n        .def(bp::self_ns::str(bp::self))\n        ;\n    bp::register_ptr_to_python<APtr>();\n\n    bp::class_<ACont, AContPtr, boost::noncopyable>(\"ACont\", bp::no_init)\n        .def(\"__init__\", bp::make_constructor(CreateEmptyACont))\n        .def(\"__init__\", bp::make_constructor(CreateFullACont))\n        .def(\"__iter__\", bp::iterator<ACont>())\n        .def(\"__len__\", &ACont::size)\n        ;\n    bp::register_ptr_to_python<AContPtr>();\n}\n\nAnyway, thank you all for your effort trying to help. :)\n\n", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "StackExchange"}}
{"text": "Introduction {#s1}\n============\n\nBiological nitrogen fixation, the conversion of atmospheric N~2~ to NH~3~, plays an important role in the global nitrogen cycle and in world agriculture [@pgen.1004231-Falkowski1]. Nitrogen fixation is mainly catalyzed by the Mo-nitrogenase. The ability to fix nitrogen is widely, but sporadically distributed among Archaea and Bacteria which includes these families: Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Cyanobacteria, Actinobacteria and Chlorobi [@pgen.1004231-DosSantos1]. Also, the contents and organization of nitrogen fixation (*nif*) genes vary significantly among the different N~2~-fixing organisms. For example, in *Klebsiella pneumoniae*, twenty *nif* genes are co-located within a \u223c24 kb cluster [@pgen.1004231-Arnold1], whereas in *Azotobacter vinelandii* the *nif* genes are more dispersed and distributed as two clusters in the genome [@pgen.1004231-Setubal1]. The random distribution pattern and the difference in contents and organization of *nif* genes raise the question of origins and evolution of Mo-nitrogenase. Phylogenetic inference based on the sequences of *nif* genes is generally used to understand the evolution of *nif* genes [@pgen.1004231-Normand1]--[@pgen.1004231-Hartmann1]. Two conflicting hypotheses for origins of Mo-nitrogenase have been proposed on the basis of phylogenetic examination of Mo-nitrogenase protein sequences (NifHDK) [@pgen.1004231-Raymond1]--[@pgen.1004231-Boyd2]. One is the last common ancestor (LCA) hypothesis which implies that the Mo-nitrogenase had its origin in a common ancestor of the bacterial and archaeal domains. According to the LCA model gene loss has been extensive and accounts for the fact that nitrogenase is found neither in eukaryotes nor in many entire phyla of prokaryotes. The other is the methanogen origin hypothesis which implies that nitrogen fixation was originated in methanogenic archaea and subsequently was transferred into a primitive bacterium via horizontal gene transfer (HGT).\n\nRemarkable progress in sequencing technology has advanced in understanding genetics and phylogenetic history of nitrogen fixation. For example, genome sequences of several diazotrophs, such as *Pseudomonas stutzeri* A1501 [@pgen.1004231-Yan1], *Herbaspirillum seropedicae* SmR1 [@pgen.1004231-Pedrosa1] and *Wolinella succinogenes* [@pgen.1004231-Baar1], revealed that the Mo-nitrogenase genes constitute a nitrogen fixation cluster or island. The *nif* genes of *P. stutzeri*, including *nifQ*, *nifA*, *nifL*, *nifH*, *nifD*, *nifK*, *nifT*, *nifY*, *nifE*, *nifN*, *nifX*, *nifS*, *nifU*, *nifW*, *nifZ*, *nifM* and *nifF* are distributed in a 49-kb region. The *nif* genes of *H. seropedicae*, including *nifA*, *nifB*, *nifZ*, *nifZ1*, *nifH*, *nifD*, *nifK*, *nifE*, *nifN*, *nifX*, *nifQ*, *nifW*, *nifV*, *nifU* and *nifS* are in a region spanning 37 kb interspersed with *fix, mod, hes, fdx, hsc* and other genes. Variation of G+C content between the *nif* cluster and the genome average in *P. stutzeri* A1501 and existence of transposase near the *nif* cluster in *H. seropedicae* SmR1 are indicative of HGT of *nif* gene clusters [@pgen.1004231-Pedrosa1]. However, since nitrogen fixation is an ancient complex process and is widely, but sporadically distributed among prokaryote families, further extensive genome sequences are needed to completely resolve the evolutionary history of nitrogenase.\n\nMo-nitrogenase is composed of two proteins, dinitrogenase (MoFe protein) and dinitrogenase reductase (Fe protein). The MoFe protein is an \u03b1~2~\u03b2~2~ heterotetramer (encoded by *nifDK*) that contains the iron--molybdenum cofactors (FeMo-co) and P clusters. The FeMo-co is a \\[Mo-7Fe-9S-homocitrate\\] cluster which serves as the active site of substrate binding and reduction. The P-cluster is a \\[8Fe-7S\\] cluster which shuttles electrons to the FeMo-co. The Fe protein is a \u03b3~2~ homodimer (encoded by *nifH*) bridged by an intersubunit \\[4Fe-4S\\] cluster that serves as the obligate electron donor to the MoFe protein. In addition to the structural genes *nifHDK*, other genes *nifE nifN*, *nifX nifB*, *nifQ*, *nifV*, *nifY*, *nifU*, *nifS*, *nif*Z and *nifM* contribute to the synthesis of FeMo-co and maturation of nitrogenase [@pgen.1004231-Hu1]--[@pgen.1004231-Kaiser1]. Although the majority of present-day biological N~2~ reduction is catalyzed by the Mo-nitrogenase, two homologous alternative nitrogenases: V- and Fe-nitrogenase are important biological sources of fixed nitrogen in environments where Mo is limiting [@pgen.1004231-Joerger1]. V- and Fe-nitrogenase are encoded by the *vnf* and *anf* genes. The Mo-, V- and Fe-nitrogenases are not equally distributed in nature. Most of diazotrophs, such as *K. pneumoniae*, possesses only the Mo-nitrogenase [@pgen.1004231-Rubio2]. While some organisms, like *A. vinelandii*, possess all three types of nitrogenases [@pgen.1004231-Chisnell1] and other organisms, like *Rhodobacter capsulatus* and *Rhodospirillum rubrum*, carry the Mo- and Fe-nitrogenases [@pgen.1004231-Davis1], [@pgen.1004231-Schneider1].\n\n*Paenibacillus* is a large genus of Gram-positive, facultative anaerobic, endospore-forming bacteria. Members of this genus are biochemically and morphologically diverse and are found in various environments, such as soil, rhizosphere, insect larvae, and clinical samples [@pgen.1004231-Lal1]--[@pgen.1004231-Ouyang1]. Originally *Paenibacillus* was included within the genus *Bacillus*, however in 1993 it was reclassified as a separate genus [@pgen.1004231-Ash1]. At that time, the genus *Paenibacillus* encompassed 11 species including the three N~2~-fixing species *Paenibacillus polymyxa*, *Paenibacillus macerans* and *Paenibacillus azotofixans* [@pgen.1004231-Ash1]. The genus *Paenibacillus* currently comprises more than 120 named species, more than 20 of which have nitrogen fixation ability, including the following 8 novel species described by our laboratory: *Paenibacillus sabinae*, *Paenibacillus zanthoxyli*, *Paenibacillus forsythiae*, *Paenibacillus sonchi*, *Paenibacillus sophorae*, *Paenibacillus jilunlii*, *P. taohuashanense* and *P. beijingensis* [@pgen.1004231-Ma1]--[@pgen.1004231-Wang1]. Although diazotrophic *Paenibacillus* strains have potential uses as a bacterial fertilizer in agriculture, genomic information to date is limited and the genetics and evolution of nitrogen fixation of these diazotrophs are unknown.\n\nHere we sequenced 11 N~2~-fixing *Paenibacillus* strains and compared these strains to each other and to 20 other strains (4 N~2~-fixing and 16 non-N~2~-fixing strains) that were sequenced previously. These strains were obtained from plant rhizhospheres, hot spring and human body and from Brazil, China, Korea, Israel, France, Belgium, United States of America, etc. ([Table 1](#pgen-1004231-t001){ref-type=\"table\"}). Our study revealed that a *nif* gene cluster comprising *nifB*, *nifH*, *nifD*, *nifK*, *nifE*, *nifN*, *nifX*, *hesA* and *nifV* encoding Mo-nitrogenase is highly conserved in the 15 N~2~-fixing strains. Also, two homologous alternative nitrogenases: V- and Fe-nitrogenase encoded by the *vnf* and *anf* genes, respectively, are found in some *Paenibacillus* species. HGT, gene loss and gene duplication of *nif*, *vnf* and *anf* genes have contributed to evolution of nitrogen fixation in *Paenibacillus*. This study not only reveals the organization and distribution of *nif*/*anf/vnf* genes and the evolutionary patterns of nitrogen fixation in *Paenibacillus*, but also provides support for the methanogen origin hypothesis for *nif* evolution [@pgen.1004231-Boyd1], [@pgen.1004231-Boyd2].\n\n10.1371/journal.pgen.1004231.t001\n\n###### *Paenibacillus* strains used in study.\n\n![](pgen.1004231.t001){#pgen-1004231-t001-1}\n\n  Strains                                                       Source                         Nitrogen fixer         Genome sequence\n  -------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------- ---------------- -----------------------------\n  *Paenibacillus* sp.

Of the 55504 putative protein-coding genes, 37105, which made up 66.9% of the genes in the pan genome, were represented in only one genome of *Paenibacillus* spp., suggesting a high frequency of horizontal gene acquisition from other taxa. In contrast to the pan-genome, the genus *Paenibacillus* had the core genome of 680 putative protein-coding genes, which represents only 9% to 15% of the repertoire of protein coding genes of each strain, illustrating a large degree of genomic diversity in this group of bacteria ([Figure 1](#pgen-1004231-g001){ref-type=\"fig\"}). The genomic data are consistent with the fact that *Paenibacillus* strains are morphologically and physiologically diverse.\n\n![Genomic diversity of strains in the genus *Paenibacillus*.\\\nEach strain is represented by an oval that is colored: N~2~-fixing strains (red), non- N~2~-fixing strains (purple). The number of orthologous coding sequences (CDSs) shared by all strains (i.e., the core genome) is in the center. Overlapping regions show the number of CDSs conserved only within the specified genomes. Numbers in non-overlapping portions of each oval show the number of CDSs unique to each strain. The total number of protein coding genes within each genome is listed below the strain name.](pgen.1004231.g001){#pgen-1004231-g001}\n\nWe further comparatively analyze the core genome of 15 N~2~-fixing and 16 non-N~2~-fixing *Paenibacillus* strains. We found that non-N~2~-fixing strains had the core genome of 908 putative protein-coding genes, which made up 12--20% of protein-coding genes in each strain. N~2~-fixing strains had the core genome of 1264 putative protein-coding genes, which code 14--24% of the protein pool in each genome. Further, we use Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COG) assignments to determine whether there were differences in the proportion of the core genome attributable to a particular cellular process ([Figure 2](#pgen-1004231-g002){ref-type=\"fig\"} and [Table S2](#pgen.1004231.s017){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). Interestingly, core genome of N~2~-fixing strains was found to be disproportionally enriched in cell motility and chemotaxis genes (Fisher\\'s exact test; P value\\<0.01). Since these N~2~-fixing strains were isolated from plant rhizospheres, cell motility and chemotaxis are of importance for bacterial adaptation to the ever-changing rhizosphere environment [@pgen.1004231-Merritt1].\n\n![Functional classification of gene content of the 31 *Paenibacillus* strains.\\\n(A) Profiles of Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COG) showing percentage of genes in each category out of total annotated genes.

Each *Paenibacillus* genome in this study contains a unique set of transposons ([Table S3](#pgen.1004231.s018){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). The number of transposon copies pergenome ranges from 3 (*P. polymyxa* SC2) to 118 (*P. sophorae* S27). Members of the IS3, IS4, IS5, IS1182 and IS200/IS605 families are most common. However, there is not a large difference in numbers of transposable elements between other N~2~-fixing and non-N~2~-fixing strains.\n\nProphage {#s2d}\n--------\n\nHere prophages were identified using PHAST. Each genome of the 31 strains contains 1--10 prophages and/or prophage remnants, ranging in size from 14.4 to 59.1 kb. Collectively, the 31 genomes have 16 intact prophages and 69 prophage remnants. The newly-sequenced genomes have 38 prophages, most of which have a set of cargo genes that encode putative bacteriocins, DNA replication protein DnaD, ABC transporter ATP-binding protein, Non-ribosomal peptide synthase module containing protein adenine- and cytosine-specific DNA methyltransferases, and DNA/RNA helicase ([Table S4](#pgen.1004231.s019){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). However, there is not a large difference in numbers of prophages between other N~2~-fixing and non-N~2~-fixing strains.\n\nThe *nif* gene cluster is highly conserved in *Paenibacillus* {#s2e}\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nComparison of COG assignments between non-N~2~-fixing and N~2~-fixing *Paenibacillus* strains ([Table S2](#pgen.1004231.s017){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}) revealed that 9 core genes in the N~2~-fixing strains: *nifB*, *nifH*, *nifD*, *nifK*, *nifE*, *nifN*, *nifX*, *hesA* and *nifV*, which are organized as a *nif* gene cluster arranged within an 10.5--12 kb genomic region, are conserved in all of the 15 N~2~-fixing strains ([Figure 3](#pgen-1004231-g003){ref-type=\"fig\"}, [Table S5](#pgen.1004231.s020){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). The *nifH*, *nifD* and *nifK* are structural genes for Mo-nitrogenase, and the *nifB*, *nifE*, *nifN*, *nifX* and *nifV* are involved in synthesis of FeMo-cofactor. The gene *hesA*, which is located between *nifX* and *nifV*, is also found in the *nif* clusters of *Frankia* [@pgen.1004231-Oh1] and cyanobacteria [@pgen.1004231-Welsh1]. HesA (also being called NAD/FAD-binding protein) is a member of the ThiF-MoeB-HesA family, which is involved in molybdopterin and thiamine biosynthesis. Our recent studies demonstrated that HesA is required for efficient nitrogen fixation in *Paenibacillus* [@pgen.1004231-Wang2]. As shown in [Figure S1](#pgen.1004231.s001){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}, the numbers of *nif* genes and size of the *nif* cluster of *Paenibacillus* are much smaller than those of *Frankia*, cyanobacteria, *Chlorobia* (green sulfur) and Proteobacteria.\n\n![Organization of *nif*, *vnf*, *anf* and *nif*-like genes in N~2~-fixing *Paenibacillus* strains.\\\n*nif*, *vnf*, *anf* and *nif*-like genes are marked with different colors.

The 9 genes *nifBHDKENXhesAnifV* of the *nif* gene cluster within Sub-group I are contiguous, while there is an *orf* of 261--561 bp, whose predicted product is unknown, between *nifX* and *hesA* within Sub-group II. Except those of *P. massiliensis* T7 within Sub-group I, and *P. sonchi* X19-5 and *P. graminis* RSA19 within Sub-group II, the *nif* gene clusters generally exhibited more than 90% identity among each Sub-group and about 80% identity between two Sub-groups,\n\nThe G+C contents of the *nif* clusters are higher than those of the average of the entire genomes in other 14 N~2~-fixing *Paenibacillus* strains (52--55 vs. 44--54) except that the *nif* cluster of *P. sabinae* T27 has the same G+C with the genome ([Figure 4](#pgen-1004231-g004){ref-type=\"fig\"}). There is a transposase gene, an indicative of HGT, near the *nif* clusters of *Paenibacillus* sp. Aloe-11 and *P. sabinae* T27 ([Figure S2](#pgen.1004231.s002){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}).

We found that ABC transporter ATP-binding protein gene and beta-fructosidase gene/fg-gap repeat protein gene were conserved in the downstream and upstream, respectively, of the *nif* clusters in the 7 N~2~-fixing *Paenibacillus* strains (*P. polymyxa* 1--43, *P. polymyxa* WLY78, *P. polymyxa* TD-94, *P. beijingensis* 1--18, *Paenibacillus*. sp.

Unlike in Sub-group I, integral membrane protein gene and FAD/FMN-containing dehydrogenase gene/methyltranferase gene were conserved in the downstream and upstream, respectively, of the *nif* clusters in all of the 7 N~2~-fixing *Paenibacillus* species (*P. sonchi* X19-5, *P. graminis* RSA19, *P. azotofixans* ATCC 35681, *P. sophorae* S27, *P. zanthoxyli* JH29, *P. forsythia* T98 and *P. sabinae* T27) within Sub-group II ([Figure 5C](#pgen-1004231-g005){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Combination of the findings that *nif* clusters fall into two sub-groups according to their identities, these data imply at least two independent acquisitions with insertion of distinct *nif* variants in different genomic sites of *Paenibacillus*.\n\n![Synteny of the chromosomal regions flanking the *nif* gene cluster among each sub-group.\\\n(A) *nif* clusters of Sub-group I.

Our results are consistent with the report that *nif* gene cluster was lost in cyanobacteria [@pgen.1004231-Welsh1].\n\nSporadic occurrence of alternative nitrogenase {#s2g}\n----------------------------------------------\n\nAs shown in [Figure 3](#pgen-1004231-g003){ref-type=\"fig\"}, in addition to the *nif* cluster encoding Mo-nitrogenase, 2 strains have *vnfHDGKEN* encoding V-nitrogenase and 2 strains have *anfHDGK* encoding Fe-nitrogenase. In *P. sophorae* S27 and *P. forsythia* T98, *anfHDGK* are linked with *nifBENX*, forming a 9.1--9.7 kb cluster. In *P. zanthoxyli* JH29 and *P. azotofixans* ATCC 35681, *vnfHDGKEN* are linked with *nifBENXV, fepBCD* (encoding iron-enterobactin transporter subunits), *leuA* and other unknown genes, forming a 20.4--20.9 kb cluster. These *anf/vnf* clusters are flanked by genes coding for hypothetical proteins. Each alternative nitrogenase cluster contains, as a minimum, *vnf*/*anfH*, *D*, *G*, and *K*. The organizations of *vnf* or *anf* are largely consistent, but distinct with those of *A. vinelandii* and *Methanococcus maripaludis* [@pgen.1004231-Setubal1], [@pgen.1004231-Leigh2]. It is most likely that *anf* or *vnf* gene cluster was recently horizontally transferred to N~2~-fixing strains which have already had a *nif* cluster, producing the *P. sophorae* S27, *P. forsythia* T98, *P. zanthoxyli* JH29 and *P. azotofixans*.\n\nThe origin of *nif*/*vnf*/*anf* in *Paenibacillus* {#s2h}\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nTo gain insights into the origin of *nif*/*vnf*/*anf* genes in *Paenibacillus*, a Bayesian inferred phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the concatenated Nif/Vnf/AnfHDK proteins. Results shown in [Figure 6](#pgen-1004231-g006){ref-type=\"fig\"} indicate that Nif/Vnf/AnfHDK proteins of *Paenibacillus* strains fall into three distinct lineages. This phylogeny exhibits that NifHDK protein homologs formed two distinct clades, one of which was comprised of proteins from hydrogenotrophic methanogens and the other was comprised of proteins from both bacterial and methanogen genomes, in agreement with methanogen origin hypothesis of nitrogen fixation proposed by Boyd et al [@pgen.1004231-Boyd1]. Our phylogenetic analysis of the concatenated NifHDK derived from the *nifHDK* of the *nif* clusters reveals that all of the 15 N~2~-fixing *Paenibacillus* strains form a coherent cluster consisting of two sub-groups, in agreement with the two sub-groups of *nif* clusters ([Figure 7](#pgen-1004231-g007){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Notably, the phylogeny reveals that *Paenibacillus* and *Frankia* are sister groups to the exclusion of the Firmicute *Clostridium*, implying that *Paenibacillus* and *Frankia* have a common *nif* gene ancestor. Phylogenies derived from each of the individual NifB, H, D, K, E, N, X and V are congruent with the phylogeny of the concatenated NifHDK ([Figure S3](#pgen.1004231.s003){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}, [S4](#pgen.1004231.s004){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}, [S5](#pgen.1004231.s005){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}, [S6](#pgen.1004231.s006){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}, [S7](#pgen.1004231.s007){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}, [S8](#pgen.1004231.s008){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}, [S9](#pgen.1004231.s009){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}, [S10](#pgen.1004231.s010){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}).\n\n![Bayesian inferred phylogenetic tree of concatenated NifHDK homologs.\\\nThe interior node values of the tree are clade credibility values, values lower than 100% are indicated.

Phylogeny derived from each of the individual VnfH/AnfH, D, G, K, E, N and X is congruent with the phylogeny of the concatenated Vnf/AnfHDK ([Figure S3](#pgen.1004231.s003){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}, [S4](#pgen.1004231.s004){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}, [S5](#pgen.1004231.s005){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}, [S6](#pgen.1004231.s006){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}, [S7](#pgen.1004231.s007){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}, [S8](#pgen.1004231.s008){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}, [S9](#pgen.1004231.s009){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}, [S10](#pgen.1004231.s010){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). *anf* and *vnf* of *Paenibacillus* are nested with those of archaeon *M. acetivorans*, supporting that the ancestor of *anf* and *vnf* may originate from archaea.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis {#s2i}\n---------------------\n\nWe reconstructed the phylogeny of the 31 genomes based on the concatenation of the 275 core genes that are present in single copy in a genome. The 18 strains including 15 N~2~-fixing strains and 3 non-N~2~-fixing strains form a large group including two sub-groups and the other 13 non-N~2~-fixing strains fall into a large group ([Figure 7](#pgen-1004231-g007){ref-type=\"fig\"}). The clustering resulting from phylogenetic analysis corresponds well with the species assignments based on average nucleotide identity (ANI) using MUMmer (ANIm) ([Table S6](#pgen.1004231.s021){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}) [@pgen.1004231-Richter1]. For examples, *P. mucilaginosus* K02, *P. mucilaginosus* 3016 and *P. mucilaginosus* KNP414 have higher ANIm (98%). N~2~-fixing strains *P. polymyxa* 1--43, *P. polymyxa* WLY78 and *P. polymyxa* TD94 isolated from China, and non-N~2~-fixing strains *P. polymyxa* SC2 and *P. polymyxa* E681 isolated from China and South Korea, respectively, have higher ANIm (\\>95%). It is noteworthy that the other 2 unnamed strains Aloe-11 (ANIm\u226487%) and 1--49 (ANIm\\<93%) may represent a novel species, respectively.\n\nThis phylogeny suggests that the *Paenibacillus* ancestor was probably non-fixing and the N~2~-fixing *Paenibacillus* strains appeared to occur much later than non-N~2~-fixing strains. Combination of the data that the *nif* cluster is conversed in the 15 N~2~-fixing *Paenibacillus* strains and the G+C contents of the *nif* clusters are higher than those of the average of the entire genomes, we proposed that N~2~-fixing *Paenibacillus* strains were generated by acquiring the *nif* cluster via HGT.\n\nThe N~2~-fixing strains of *Paenibacillus* fall into a large group composed of 2 distinct sub-groups (Sub-group I and Sub-group II), which were likely originated from a N~2~-fixing common ancestor. This species phylogeny is congruent with the phylogeny of *nif* genes. The phylogeny suggests that the 8 N~2~-fixing strains and the 3 non-N~2~-fixing strains within Sub-group I are most closely related. Nitrogen fixation may have been present in the ancestor of the 8 N~2~-fixing strains (*P. polymyxa* 1--43, *P. polymyxa* WLY78, *P. polymyxa* TD-94, *P. beijingensis*1--18, *Paenibacillus*. sp. Aloe-11, *Paenibacillus* sp. 1--49, *P. terrae* HPL-003 and *P. massiliensis* T7) and the 3 non-N~2~-fixing strains (*P. polymyxa* SC2, *P. polymyxa* E681 and *P. peoriae* KCTC 3763), and was later lost in the 3 non-N~2~-fixing strains. This phylogeny also shows that the 7 N~2~-fixing strains within Sub-group II (*P. sonchi* X19-5, *P. graminis* RSA19, *P. azotofixans* ATCC 35681, *P. sophorae* S27, *P. zanthoxyli* JH29, *P. forsythia* T98 and *P. sabinae* T27) are sister group with the 4 non-N~2~-fixing strains *P. lactis* 154, *P. vortex* V453, *Paenibacillus* sp. Y412MC10 and *Paenibacillus* sp. HGF5. Nitrogen fixation may have been present in the ancestor of the 7 N~2~-fixing and 4 non-N~2~-fixing strains and the *nif* genes were lost, producing the non-N~2~-fixing *P. lactis* 154 lineage.\n\nTaken together, the *Paenibacillus* ancestor was probably non-fixing and the N~2~-fixing strains of *Paenibacillus* can be classified into 2 distinct sub-groups, which were likely originated from a N~2~-fixing common ancestor with minor variation in *nif* sequences. N~2~-fixing *Paenibacillus* strains were generated by acquiring the *nif* cluster in early evolutionary history via HGT from a source related to *Frankia*. After these initial acquisitions of the *nif* gene clusters, the strains that have them now have inherited them by vertical transmission. However, during the process of evolution, the *nif* cluster was lost, producing the 3 non-N~2~-fixing strains *P. polmyxa* SC2, *P. polmyxa* E681 and *P. peoriae* KCTC 3763 and the non-N~2~-fixing lineage *P. lactis* 154. There were recent events of acquisition of *vnf* and *anf* genes, causing further diversification of strains within Sub-group II. The most likely pathways of nitrogen fixation evolution are summarized in [Figure 7](#pgen-1004231-g007){ref-type=\"fig\"}.\n\nThe *nif* gene cluster is a functional unit for nitrogen fixation {#s2j}\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo investigate that the *nif* gene cluster is a functional unit for nitrogen fixation, the contiguous nine genes *nifBHDKENXhesAnifV* of the *nif* cluster and the *nifB* promoter from *P. beijinesis* 1--18, a representative of N~2~-fixing *Paenibacillus* strains, was PCR amplified and then constructed to vector pHY300PLK and further transferred to *E. coli* JM109. This yielded the recombinant *E. coli* strain 1--18. Nitrogenase activity was determined using the acetylene reduction assay (expressed as nmol C~2~H~4~/hr/mg protein) [@pgen.1004231-Xie2] and a ^15^N~2~ enrichment assay (expressed as \u03b4^15^N) [@pgen.1004231-Montoya1]. As shown in [Figure S11](#pgen.1004231.s011){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}, the nine genes *nifBHDKENXhesAnifV* within the *nif* cluster enabled *E. coli* to fix nitrogen, in agreement with our recent report obtained in *P. polmyxa* WLY78 [@pgen.1004231-Wang2]. The results indicate that the *nif* cluster is a functional unit for nitrogen fixation, and also a unit of HGT.\n\nThe *nif* gene cluster possesses a \u03c3^70^-dependent promoter and a GlnR/TnrA-binding site {#s2k}\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe recently determined that the nine genes *nifB*, *nifH*, *nifD*, *nifK*, *nifE*, *nifN*, *nifX*, *hesA* and *nifV* within the *nif* gene cluster in *P. polmyxa* WLY78 were organized as an operon and that the *nifB* promoter of the *nif* cluster is a \u03c3^70^-dependent promoter \u221235 (TTGACT) and \u221210 (TAAGAT) [@pgen.1004231-Wang2]. Here we revealed using bioinformatics analysis that the *nif* genes within the *nif* gene clusters among the other 14 N~2~-fixing *Paenibacillus* strains are organized as an operon and each of the *nif* clusters has a \u03c3^70^-dependent promoter ([Figure S12](#pgen.1004231.s012){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). The \u03c3^70^-dependent promoter is very distinct from the typical \u03c3^54^-dependent \u221224/\u221212 promoters found upstream of *nif* genes in Gram-negative N~2~-fixing bacteria, such as *K. pneumoniae* and *A. vinelandii*, whose *nif* gene expression requires the activation of the transcriptional activator NifA according to the concentration of ammonium and oxygen [@pgen.1004231-Dixon1]. Although the \u03c3^70^-dependent promoter is highly conserved among the 15 N~2~-fixing *Paenibacillus* strains, there are some variations in length of interval sequence between the putative transcriptional start site (TSS) and translation start codon (ATG) of *nifB* ([Figure S12](#pgen.1004231.s012){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}).\n\nUnlike in Gram-negative diazotrophs, there is neither *nifA* gene encoding transcriptional activator NifA, nor NifA-binding site in the promoter region of the *nif* gene cluster. However, the genomes of the 15 N~2~-fixing *Paenibacillus* strains have *glnR* gene. In the Gram-positive model organism *Bacillus subtilis*, two transcriptional factors, TnrA and GlnR, control gene expression in response to nitrogen availability [@pgen.1004231-Kormelink1], [@pgen.1004231-Doroshchuk1]. TnrA activates and represses gene transcription when nitrogen is limiting for growth, while GlnR represses gene expression during growth with excess nitrogen. The two proteins bind to DNA sequences (GlnR/TnrA-sites) with a common consensus sequence (TGTNAN7TNACA) [@pgen.1004231-Kormelink1], [@pgen.1004231-Doroshchuk1]. Here we found that the GlnR/TnrA-binding sites exist in the *nif* promoter regions of the 15 N~2~-fixing *Paenibacillus* genomes ([Figure S12](#pgen.1004231.s012){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). The GlnR/TnrA-binding sites are located upstream of the \u03c3^70^-dependent promoter (\u221235 and \u221210) region in Sub-group I strains and some Sub-group II strains, while they are located downstream of the \u221235 and \u221210 regions in some Sub-group II strains. The existence of GlnR/TnrA-sites in *nif* promoter region suggests that regulation mechanisms of nitrogen fixation in *Paenibacillus* may be different from those of Gram-negative N~2~-fixing organisms.\n\nSuf system encoding \\[Fe--S\\] cluster is highly conserved in N~2~-fixing and non-N~2~-fixing *Paenibacillus* strains {#s2l}\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMo-nitrogenase is a complex \\[Fe-S\\] enzyme and the \\[Fe-S\\] clusters of nitrogenase play a critical function in electron transfer and in the reduction of substrates driven by the free energy liberated from Mg-ATP hydrolysis [@pgen.1004231-Rubio2]. NifU and NifS are generally thought to be specialized for the nitrogenase \\[Fe-S\\] cluster assembly of nitrogen-fixing bacteria [@pgen.1004231-Zhao1]. However, the genomes of the 15 N~2~-fixing *Paenibacillus* strains involved in this study do not possess homologues of *nifU* and *nifS*. Here we discovered that a Suf system (*sufCDSUB* operon) responsible for the formation of \\[Fe-S\\] clusters is highly conserved in N~2~-fixing and non-N~2~-fixing *Paenibacillus* strains. Suf system has been reported in *E. coli* (*sufABCDSE*) and some other organisms [@pgen.1004231-Johnson1]. We deduce that *sufCDSUB* operon in N~2~-fixing *Paenibacillus* strains are involved in synthesis of the \\[Fe-S\\] clusters of nitrogenase and other FeS proteins. Perhaps it is because there is a *sufCDSUB* operon in non-N~2~-fixing *Paenibacillus* strain, a single event of HGT of the *nif* gene cluster will transfer a non-N~2~-fixing *Paenibacillus* strain to a N~2~-fixing *Paenibacillus* strain.\n\nMultiple *nif* genes in *Paenibacillus* {#s2m}\n---------------------------------------\n\nIn addition to *nifBHDKENXhesAnifV* within the *nif* gene cluster, there is a set of additional *nifBEN* which are linked together with *vnf* or *anf* in the 4 species: *P. zanthoxyli* JH29 and *P. azotofixans* ATCC 35681, *P. sophorae* S27 and *P. forsythia* T98. Since the additional *nifBEN* form a cluster with *vnf* or *anf*, it is likely that they were horizontally transferred to the 4 species with *vnf* or *anf*. There are a cluster of *nifHBEN*, 2 *nifB* and 1 *nifH* located at different sites outside of the *nif* gene cluster in *P. sabinae* T27. The phylogenetic trees based on each of the individual NifB, NifH, NifE and NifN protein sequences ([Figure S3](#pgen.1004231.s003){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}, [S4](#pgen.1004231.s004){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}, [S5](#pgen.1004231.s005){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}, [S6](#pgen.1004231.s006){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}, [S7](#pgen.1004231.s007){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}, [S8](#pgen.1004231.s008){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}, [S9](#pgen.1004231.s009){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}, [S10](#pgen.1004231.s010){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}) show that each of them is clustered with its homolog derived from the *nif* gene clusters of *Paenibacillus*, suggesting that these genes derived from gene duplication. Transposases near the *nifBHEN* and *nifB* in *P. sabinae* T27 suggest that these genes may originate from gene duplication ([Figure S2](#pgen.1004231.s002){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). Our previous results demonstrated that the 3 *nifH* genes from *P. sabinae* T27 could complement the *K. pneumoniae nifH^\u2212^* mutant [@pgen.1004231-Hong2], suggesting that these *nifH* genes are functional in nitrogen fixation. However, we are not sure that the multiple *nifHBEN* are positively related to high nitrogenase activity.\n\nMultiple nitrogenase-like genes in *Paenibacillus* {#s2n}\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nOur studies revealed that there are nitrogenase-like genes including 1--2 *nifH*-like and 4--6 pairs of *nifDK*-like genes in the 5 species within Sub-group II: *P. azotofixans* ATCC 35681, *P. sophorae* S27, *P. zanthoxyli* JH29, *P. forsythia* T98 and *P. sabinae* T27 ([Figure 3](#pgen-1004231-g003){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Alignments of NifH-like sequences with NifH sequences show that 4Fe-4S iron sulfur cluster ligating cysteines (Cys97 and Cys132), ADP-ribose binding arginine (Arg101) and the P-loop/MgATP binding motif are invariant, suggesting that NifH-like proteins may function analogously to NifH (\u03b3 subunit of nitrogenase) ([Figure S13](#pgen.1004231.s013){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). Conversely, NifD/NifK-like sequences are highly diverged from both \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits of nitrogenase. For example, FeMoco-ligating residues at \u03b1Cys275 and \u03b1His442, and P-cluster-ligating residues at Cys62, Cys88 and Cys154 of NifD, are not conserved in NifD-like sequences ([Figure S14](#pgen.1004231.s014){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). The residues ligating P-cluster at Cys70, Cys95 and Cys153 of NifK are not conserved in NifK-like sequences ([Figure S15](#pgen.1004231.s015){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). Our results are in agreement with previous reports obtained in studies with Archaea and Firmicutes *Clostridium* [@pgen.1004231-Setubal1], [@pgen.1004231-Raymond1]. Further, phylogenetic analysis reveals that the NifH/NifD/NifK-like sequences form distinct groups which are clearly divergent from conventional nitrogenase ([Figure 8](#pgen-1004231-g008){ref-type=\"fig\"}).\n\n![Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree of Mo-, Fe- and V-nitrogenases and nitrogenase-like sequences.\\\nNif/Vnf/AnfH, Nif/Vnf/AnfD, Nif/Vnf/AnfK, Nif/Vnf/AnfH-like, Nif/Vnf/AnfD-like and Nif/Vnf/AnfK sequences were derived from the 15 N~2~-fixing *Paenibacillus* strains and other representative species.](pgen.1004231.g008){#pgen-1004231-g008}\n\nDiscussion {#s3}\n==========\n\nIn this study, we sequenced the genomes of 11 N~2~-fixing *Paenibacillus* strains and made a comparative genomic analysis with 20 other strains (4 N~2~-fixing and 16 non-N~2~-fixing strains) that were sequenced previously. Our analysis of the total 31 genomes revealed that of the 55504 putative protein-coding genes, 37105, which made up 66.9% of the genes in the pan genome, were represented in only one genome of *Paenibacillus* spp., suggesting a remarkable degree of HGT in shaping the genomes of each of the genus. It is generally accepted that abundance of mobile genetic elements correlates positively with the frequency of HGT. We discovered that each genome of all of the 31 strains contains 1--10 prophages and/or prophage remnants and 3--118 IS elements, supporting that these strains are rich in mobile genetic elements. The existence of transposable elements and prophage near the *nif* gene and *nif* gene cluster suggest that they may be involved in HGT and loss of *nif* genes. Our demonstration that the *nif* cluster from *P. beijinesis* 1--18 enabled *E. coli* to have nitrogen fixation ability supports that the *nif* cluster is a functional unit for nitrogen fixation and also a unit of HGT.\n\nGenomic islands are known to have contributed to the evolution of microbial genomes by HGT in many bacteria, influencing traits such as antibiotic resistance, symbiosis and fitness, and adaptation in general [@pgen.1004231-Hacker1]. The evolutionary advantage of genomic islands is that a large number of genes (e.g. operon, gene clusters encoding related functions) may be horizontally transferred and incorporated en bloc into the recipient genome in a single step [@pgen.1004231-Hacker2]. Genome sequence analysis here revealed that nine genes *nifB*, *nifH*, *nifD*, *nifK*, *nifE*, *nifN*, *nifX*, *hesA* and *nifV* which are organized as a cluster arranged within 10.5--12 kb region are highly conserved in the 15 N~2~-fixing *Paenibacillus* strains. The sizes of *nif* clusters of *Paenibacillus* fall into the range of 10--200 kb genome islands in length. Also, the G+C contents of the *nif* clusters are higher than those of the average of the genomes in 14 N~2~-fixing strains except *P. sabinae* T27, in agreement with genome islands whose G+C content often differs from that of the rest of the genome. This favored the hypothesis that the *nif* region in *Paenibacillus* constitutes a nitrogen fixation island, as discovered in other nitrogen fixers [@pgen.1004231-Baar1], [@pgen.1004231-Young1]. For example, *nif* genes are part of an island in *Wolinella succinogenes* [@pgen.1004231-Baar1] and in *Rhizobium leguminosarum* [@pgen.1004231-Young1]. *nif* genes organized as clusters are also found in many other N~2~-fixing organisms. For examples, 20 *nif* genes are organized in 8 operons (*nifJC*, *nifHDKTY*, *nifEN*, *nifUSVW*, *nifZM*, *nifF*, *nifLA*, *nifBQ*) within ca. 24 kb of DNA in the chromosome of *K. pneumoniae* [@pgen.1004231-Arnold1]. A total of 17--20 ORFs including 9--11 *nif* genes were organized as a cluster arranged within 17.3--18.5 kb regions among 4 *Frankia* strain: *Frankia* sp. EuIK1, *Frankia* sp. EAN1pec, *Frankia* sp. ACN14a and *Frankia* sp. HFPCcI3 [@pgen.1004231-Oh1]. In the *Cyanothece* 51142 genome, a representative of nonheterocystous cyanobacteria, the majority of genes involved in nitrogen fixation are located in a contiguous 28 kb cluster of 34 genes [@pgen.1004231-Welsh1]. The different gene content and organization of *nif* genes indicate that complex evolutionary history of *nif* genes, and also suggest differences in protein requirements for nitrogenase synthesis and regulation of nitrogen fixation.\n\nPhylogeny of the concatenated NifHDK proteins revealed that *Paenibacillus* and *Frankia* are sister groups to the exclusion of the Firmicute *Clostridium*, implying that *Paenibacillus* and *Frankia* have a common *nif* gene ancestor. Our results are consistent with the previous reports that *Frankia* and cyanobacterium *Anabaena* were sister groups to the exclusion of the Firmicute *Clostridium* [@pgen.1004231-Hartmann1]. Some common features found in the *nif* clusters support that *Paenibacillus* and *Frankia* are closely related. The first common feature is *hesA*, which is conserved in the *nif* clusters of *Paenibacillus, Frankia* and cyanobacteria, but not in N~2~-fixing Gram-negative and other Gram-positive bacteria, such as *Clostridium*. The second common feature is the compact organized *nifHDKENX* which is found in the *nif* clusters of *Paenibacillus* and *Frankia*, but not in *Clostridium* spp. In contrast, gene content and organization varied greatly between the *nif* clusters of *Paenibacillus* and *Clostridium*, although both genera *Paenibacillus* and *Clostridium* belong to the low G+C and Gram-positive Firmicutes. For example, *nifN-B* fusion gene was found in the *nif* gene clusters of the three species of *Clostridia*: *C. acetobutylicum*, *C. beijerinckii*, and *C. pasteurianum* [@pgen.1004231-Johnson1], [@pgen.1004231-Chen1]. Also, the *nif* gene clusters of *C. acetobutylicum* and *C. beijerinckii* have *nifI1* and *nifI2* (homologs of *glnB*), which are involved in post-translational regulation of nitrogenase activity in response to fixed nitrogen [@pgen.1004231-Dodsworth1]. These data suggest that the gene content and organization of the *nif* cluster of anaerobic *Clostridium* spp. are similar with those of *M. acetovorans* and *M. maripaudis* whose *nif* clusters also contain *nifI1* and *nifI2* located between *nifH* and *nifDK* [@pgen.1004231-Leigh2], [@pgen.1004231-Dodsworth1].\n\nPhylogeny of the concatenated 275 single-copy core genes ([Figure 7](#pgen-1004231-g007){ref-type=\"fig\"}) suggests that the ancestral *Paenibacillus* did not fix nitrogen. Genome sequencing revealed that the *nif* cluster is highly conserved in all of the 15 N~2~-fixing strains and the G+C contents of the *nif* clusters are higher than those of the average of the genomes in 14 N~2~-fixing strains except *P. sabinae* T27. Also, phylogeny of the concatenated NifHDK proteins ([Figure 6](#pgen-1004231-g006){ref-type=\"fig\"}) revealed that *Paenibacillus* and *Frankia* are sister groups. All of these facts and evidences indicate that N~2~-fixing *Paenibacillus* strains may be generated by acquiring the *nif* cluster via HGT from a source related to *Frankia* in early evolutionary history. Strain phylogeny ([Figure 7](#pgen-1004231-g007){ref-type=\"fig\"}) also shows that the 15 N~2~-fixing strains of *Paenibacillus* fall into 2 distinct sub-groups, consistent with phylogeny of *nif* genes ([Figure 6](#pgen-1004231-g006){ref-type=\"fig\"}). The *nif* clusters show some variation between two sub-groups, and the genes surrounding the *nif* clusters from two Sub-groups are conserved and distinct. These data imply at least two independent acquisitions with insertion of distinct *nif* variants in different genomic sites of *Paenibacillus*.\n\nFurthermore, strain phylogeny suggests that nitrogen fixation may have been present in the ancestor of the 8 N~2~-fixing strains (*P. polymyxa* 1--43, *P. polymyxa* WLY78, *P. polymyxa* TD94, *P. beijingensis*1--18, *Paenibacillus*. sp. Aloe-11, *Paenibacillus* sp. 1--49, *P. terrae* HPL-003 and *P. massiliensis* T7) and the 3 non-N~2~-fixing strains (*P. polmyxa* SC2, *P. polmyxa* E681 and *P. peoriae*KCTC 3763) within Sub-group I, and was later lost in the 3 non-N~2~-fixing strains (*P. polmyxa* SC2, *P. polmyxa* E681 and *P. peoriae* KCTC 3763). Notably, the model *P. polymyxa* is a N~2~-fixing species, and now this species includes both N~2~-fixing and non-N~2~-fixing strains. These closely related strains of this group were isolated from plant rhizospheres and from different geological locations of China, South Korea and Republic of Korea. Likewise, it is likely that nitrogen fixation may have been present and was later lost in the non-N~2~-fixing lineage *P. lactis* 154. The members of this lineage were isolated from complex locations. For examples, *P. lactis* 154 was isolated from milk, *Paenibacillus* sp. HGF5 from human intestinal microflora and *Paenibacillus* sp. Y412MC10 from hot spring, and *P. vortex* V453 is known to develop complex colonies with intricate architectures.\n\nThe newly sequenced genomes revealed that the 4 *Paenibacillus* species *P. sophorae* S27, *P. forsythia* T98, *P. zanthoxyli* JH29 and *P. azotofixans* have the second *nif* cluster which carrying *vnf* or *anf*, in addition to the *nif* cluster. *anfHDGK* are clustered with *nifBENX* in a 9.1--9.7 kb region in *P. sophorae* S27 and *P. forsythia* T98, *vnfHDGKEN* are clustered with *nifBENXV, fepBCD, leuA* and other unknown genes in a 20.4--20.9 kb region in *P. zanthoxyli* JH29 and *P. azotofixans* ATCC 35681. Phylogeny of the concatenated Nif/Anf/VnfHDK proteins indicates that *anfHDGK* and *vnfHDGKEN* of *Paenibacillus* originate differently from *nifHDK*, and may be not duplicated from their *nifHDK*. It is most likely that the *nif* cluster carrying *anf/vnf genes* was recently horizontally transferred to N~2~-fixing strains which have already had the *nif* cluster, producing *P. sophorae* S27, *P. forsythia* T98, *P. zanthoxyli* JH29 and *P. azotofixans*. These species were isolated from plant rhizosphere from China and Brazil. Our results are consistent with the recent reports that both Nif and Anf evolved in the methanogenic archaea, and *anf* or *vnf* derived from duplication of *nif* [@pgen.1004231-Raymond1]. As described above, phylogenies of the concatenated Anf/VnfHDK and each of individual Anf/VnfH, D and K show that *Paenibacillus* strains fall into Anf and Vnf clusters, respectively. However, we found that the conserved residues in the P-loop binding motif of AnfH do not exist in *P. sophorae* S27, and the residues ligating P-cluster at Cys70 and Cys95 of VnfK do not exist in *P. zanthoxyli* JH29. Perhaps the residues ligating P-cluster or in P-loop binding motif are located on the other sites in VnfK and AnfH, respectively.\n\nThis study reveals that HGT of *nif/anf/vnf* gene cluster contributed to evolution of nitrogen fixation in *Paenibacillus*. Usually, a vehicle is needed to transfer genes efficiently between different species. It is thought that foreign DNAs are mainly transferred by means of plasmids or bacteriophages, as well as direct uptake by the host itself [@pgen.1004231-Zhao1], [@pgen.1004231-Dobrindt1], [@pgen.1004231-Hirsch1]. The best studied example of HGT of *nif* genes is symbiosis island of *Mesorhizobium loti*. The symbiosis island, a 502-kb chromosomally integrated element containing *nif* genes, was integrated into a phenylalanine tRNA gene mediated by a P4-type integrase encoded at the left end of the symbiosis island [@pgen.1004231-Nakamura1]--[@pgen.1004231-Sullivan1]. However, a phenylalanine tRNA gene near the *nif* cluster is not found, suggesting that it may be not transferred by P4-type integrase. But we found that there is a transposase gene, an indicative of HGT, near the *nif* clusters of *Paenibacillus* sp. Aloe-11 and *P. sabinae* T27 and near the *anf* cluster of *P. sophorae* S27. Also, a transcriptional regulator gene of *araC* type, which is known to be involved primarily in regulating pathogenicity islands in some bacteria but is also present in nonpathogenic organisms [@pgen.1004231-Hacker2], neighbors the *nif* clusters of *P. polmyxa* TD94 and *Paenibacillus* sp. 1--11.\n\nThe deviant G+C content is one of the indicative used to detect HGT [@pgen.1004231-Hirsch1]. The G+C contents of the *nif* clusters are higher than those of the average of the entire genomes (52--55 vs. 44--53) in the 14 N~2~-fixing *Paenibacillus* strains except *P. sabinae* T27, supporting that the *nif* gene clusters in these strains are acquired by HGT. The similar G+C contents and high identities of *nif* genes among the 15 *nif* clusters suggest that these *nif* clusters originated from a common ancestor with minor variation. The G+C contents of the *anf* cluster is higher than the average of the genome in *P. sophorae* S27 (51% vs. 40%), and is lower than the average of the genome in *P. forsythia* T98 (51% vs. 53%). The G+C contents of the *vnf* cluster is the same (51% vs. 51%) as the average of the chromosomal genome in *P. azotofixans* ATCC 35681 and *P. zanthoxyli* JH29. A higher G+C contents of the *nif* cluster were found in some N~2~-fixing bacteria, such as *P. stutzeri* A1501 (66.8% vs. 63.8%) [@pgen.1004231-Yan1]. In rhizobia, the *nif* genes are located on either plasmids or genomic islands, which are prone to transfer between related bacteria [@pgen.1004231-Young2]. However, the G+C contents of these plasmids and genomic islands are generally lower than the average of the chromosomal genome [@pgen.1004231-Galibert1]--[@pgen.1004231-Kaneko2]. However, the G+C contents of the *nif* clusters are similar with those of the average of the entire genomes in the sequenced *Frankia* strains (69% vs. 70% in *Frankia* sp. HFPCcI3, 70% vs. 71% in *Frankia* sp. EAN1pec and 71% vs. 72% in *Frankia alni* ACN14a). It is generally accepted that although the deviant G+C content can be used to detect HGT, detection of HGT depends on a combination of several methods. This is because it is hard to detect HGT via deviant G+C content, if HGT occurred between the organisms with the same G+C contents [@pgen.1004231-Hirsch1].\n\nOur genome sequencing revealed that there are nitrogenase-like genes including 1--2 *nifH*-like and 4--6 pairs of *nifDK*-like genes in the 5 species within Sub-group II: *P. azotofixans* ATCC 35681, *P. sophorae* S27, *P. zanthoxyli* JH29, *P. forsythia* T98 and *P. sabinae* T27 ([Figure 3](#pgen-1004231-g003){ref-type=\"fig\"} and [Table S5](#pgen.1004231.s020){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). Alignment of conserved residues ligating 4Fe-4S in NifH and ligating P-cluster and FeMoco and phylogenetic analysis in in NifD/K revealed that the *nif*-like and *nifDK*-like genes are clustered with those of archaea and Firmicutes such as Clostridia [@pgen.1004231-Setubal1]. The data that NifH/NifD/NifK-like sequences fall into distinct groups by phylogenetic analysis suggest that multiple *nifH*-like and *nifDK*-like genes may result from gene duplication. The existence of transposases near the *nifDK*-like genes also suggested that multiple *nifDK*-like genes may result from gene duplication. It was proposed that Nif emerged from a nitrogenase-like ancestor approximately 1.5--2.2 Ga [@pgen.1004231-Boyd1]. We wonder why there are so many *nifDK*-like genes in these *Paenibacillus* species. The determination of the function of nitrogenase-like genes will clarify their relation with nitrogen fixation.\n\nMaterials and Methods {#s4}\n=====================\n\nGenome sequencing, assembly, and annotation {#s4a}\n-------------------------------------------\n\nThe draft sequences of 11 test *Paenibacillus* strains were produced by using Illumina paired-end sequencing technology at the BGI--Shenzhen ([Table 2](#pgen-1004231-t002){ref-type=\"table\"}). Assembly was conducted by using SOAPdenovo v. 1.04 assembler [@pgen.1004231-Li2]. Gene prediction was made using Glimmer v3.0 [@pgen.1004231-Delcher1]. Annotation of protein coding sequence was performed by using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) against the COG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases and NCBI nr protein database. The draft genomes of the 11 test *Paenibacillus* strains have been deposited in GenBank and the project accession numbers are listed in [Table 2](#pgen-1004231-t002){ref-type=\"table\"}. Prophage was identified using PHAST [@pgen.1004231-Zhou1].\n\nComparative genomics {#s4b}\n--------------------\n\nPan Genome Analysis Pipeline of PGAP [@pgen.1004231-Zhao2] was used to identify all of the orthologous pairs between test *Paenibacillus* genomes. The common dataset of shared genes among test strains was defined as their core genome. The total set of genes within test genomes was defined as the pan genome. The set of genes in each strain not shared with other strains was defined as unique genes. The average nucleotide identity (ANI) between strains of the 31 sequenced genomes were calculated using MUMmer [@pgen.1004231-Richter1]. Multiple alignment of conserved genomic sequence was using Mauve [@pgen.1004231-Darling1]. The genomes sequenced in this study are listed in [Table S1](#pgen.1004231.s016){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis {#s4c}\n---------------------\n\nSingle gene alignments were aligned with molecular evolutionary genetics analysis (MEGA) [@pgen.1004231-Tamura1]. The neighbor-joining trees were constructed by using the same software, and 1,000 bootstraps were done. Bayesian inferred phylogenetic tree of concatenated HDK homologs was generated using the MrBayes package [@pgen.1004231-Ronquist1]. A maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree of *Paenibacillus* species was constructed based on 275 single-copy core proteins shared by 31 *Paenibacillus* genomes and the genome of *Bacillus subtilis* 168 according to the following methods: (i) multiple alignment of amino acid sequences were carried out by ClustalW (version 2.1) [@pgen.1004231-Thompson1] (ii) conserved blocks from multiple alignment of test protein were selected by using Gblocks [@pgen.1004231-Castresana1] (iii) ML tree were constructed using PhyML (version 3.0) [@pgen.1004231-Guindon1] software (iv) CONSEL program [@pgen.1004231-Shimodaira1] was used to select the best model of the trees.\n\nConstruction of the recombinant plasmid and *E. coli* strain {#s4d}\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGenomic DNA of diazotrophic *P. beijingensis* 1--18 was used as a template for cloning *nif* genes. A 10.7 kb Xba I -BamH I DNA fragment containing the *nif* cluster (a 300 bp promoter region and the contiguous nine genes *nifBHDKENXhesAnifV* and 184 bp downstream of the stop codon TAA of *nifV*) was PCR amplified with primers *nif* cluster-up (5\u2032-TGCTCTAGAGGGAATATAACGTGGAGAGG-3\u2032) and *nif* cluster-down (5\u2032-CGCGGATCCCATTATACAGCACTATATTG-3\u2032) and then ligated to Xba I and BamH I sites of pHY300PLK, yielding plasmid pHY300-18 (P*nif*+*nif* cluster). The plasmid was then transferred to *E. coli* JM109, yielding the recombinant *E. coli* 1--18.\n\nAcetylene reduction assays {#s4e}\n--------------------------\n\nFor acetylene reduction assays, *P. beijingensis* 1--18 and the recombinant *E. coli* strain 18 were grown overnight in LD medium, then diluted into nitrogen-deficient medium and grown for 15--18 h. Following this stage, the cultures were collected and resuspended in an N-free medium to an OD~600~ of 0.2--0.4 in a serum bottle for nitrogenase derepression. The serum bottle was vacuumed and charged with argon gas. After 5--6 h, C~2~H~2~ (10% of the headspace volume) was injected into the serum bottle. After 30 min to 1 h, C~2~H~4~ was analyzed by Gas Chromatography [@pgen.1004231-Xie2].\n\n^15^N~2~ incorporation assay {#s4f}\n----------------------------\n\n*Paenibacillus*sp.1--18 and the recombinant *E. coli* strain 1--18 were grown overnight in LD medium. The cultures were collected and resuspended in 70 ml N-free medium to an OD~600~ of 0.4 in the 120 ml serum bottle. The serum bottles were filled with N~2~ gas, and then 8-ml gas was removed and 5 ml ^15^N~2~ (99%+, Shanghai Engineering Research Center for Stable Isotope) gas was injected. After 72 hours of incubation at 30\u00b0C, the cultures were collected, freeze dried, ground, weighed and sealed into tin capsules. Isotope ratios are expressed as \u03b4^15^N whose values are a linear transform of the isotope ratios ^15^N/^14^N, representing the per mille difference between the isotope ratios in a sample and in the atmospheric N~2~ [@pgen.1004231-Montoya1].\n\nData access {#s4g}\n-----------\n\nThe genome sequences used in this study were submitted to the GenBank, the accession number was shown in [Table 2](#pgen-1004231-t002){ref-type=\"table\"}.\n\nSupporting Information {#s5}\n======================\n\n###### \n\nComparison of the *nif* gene cluster of *Paenibacillus* with those of the representative N~2~-fixing bacteria and archaea.

We report the case of an adolescent who presented with a dermatosis-arthritis syndrome associated to a Crohn's disease during a referring for pustulosis, erythema nodosum and fever. The evolution is complicated by proctorragia. Colonoscopy and intestinal biopsy found a Crohn's disease. Cutaneous and intestinal symptoms quickly improved with systemic corticosteroids. The dermatosis-arthritis syndrome can be associated with bowel bypass and with inflammatory bowel disease, more frequently with ulcerative colitis than with Crohn's disease. It consists in a vesiculo-pustular eruption, erythema nodosum, fever, arthritis and ocular manifestations. Histopathology bears a strong resemblance with Sweet's syndrome. Physiopathology implicates microbial proliferation, formation of immune complex against skin and activation and migration of neutrophils and increasing factors.

Herndon Marine Products, Inc., appeals from the Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal of its claim against Liberty Seafood, Inc., for reimbursement of part of the maintenance and cure Herndon paid its employees.  1993 A.M.C. 2886.   Our holding that Herndon has stated a claim is compelled by our very recent decision in Bertram v. Freeport Moran, Inc., 35 F.3d 1008 (5th Cir.1994).  Accordingly, we REVERSE.\n\nI.\n\n2\nIn the Gulf of Mexico in 1991, Liberty's vessel drifted into Herndon's anchored vessel, causing damage to both and injury to the three seamen aboard Herndon's vessel.  Because of the seamen's injuries, Herndon was required to pay them maintenance and cure.1\n\n\n3\nLiberty filed an exoneration and limitation action, pursuant to 46 U.S.C.App. Sec. 181 et seq., and Rule F, Fed.R.Civ.P., Supplemental Rules for Certain Admiralty and Maritime Claims.  In addition to responding to Liberty's claim, the injured Herndon seamen filed claims against Liberty for negligence and unseaworthiness;  and Herndon filed claims against it for (1) indemnity and contribution for the maintenance and cure and for the costs of defending actions brought by the seamen, and (2) damages resulting from the loss of use of, and damage to, Herndon's vessel.\n\n\n4\nPrior to trial, Liberty settled with the three seamen and each of those claims was dismissed with prejudice.  Pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) (failure to state a claim), Liberty then moved to dismiss Herndon's claims for indemnity and contribution, contending that Herndon could not claim contribution from Liberty, a joint tortfeasor, because Liberty had settled with the seamen.  Herndon responded, inter alia, that the claim for recovery over against Liberty for maintenance and cure was separate and distinct from the settled claims with the seamen;  and that, therefore, the settlement bar rule was inapplicable.\n\n\n5\nThe district court denied Liberty's limitation claim, but found the crews of both vessels at fault in the allision, apportioning 75% to Liberty and 25% to Herndon.  No finding was made as to the percentage of fault, if any, attributable to each of the injured (and dismissed) seamen.\n\n\n6\nThereafter, in ruling on Liberty's Rule 12(b)(6) motion concerning Herndon's maintenance and cure reimbursement claim, and because it did not feel there was controlling Fifth Circuit precedent, the district court looked to the Eighth Circuit's decision in Associated Elec. Coop. v. Mid-America Transp. Co., 931 F.2d 1266 (8th Cir.1991), and held that the policies favoring settlement dictated that Liberty's settlement should bar Herndon's claim.  Accordingly, it granted the motion.  Subsequently, Herndon and Liberty settled all other claims.\n\nII.\n\n7\nAs is well-established, we review de novo the Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal, viewing all well-pleaded facts in the light most favorable to Herndon.  E.g., Cinel v. Connick, 15 F.3d 1338, 1341 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 189, --- L.Ed.2d ---- (1994).  For the reasons stated hereinafter, Herndon has stated a claim.\n\n\n8\nMaintenance and cure are maritime terms describing a seaman's right to receive food and lodging (maintenance) and necessary medical services (cure).  E.g., Davis v. Odeco, Inc., 18 F.3d 1237, 1245 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 78, 130 L.Ed.2d 32 (1994).  It is firmly established in this circuit that a shipowner required to pay maintenance and cure may recover those payments from a third-party who caused, in whole or in part, the employee's injury.  See Bertram;  see also, Adams v. Texaco, Inc., 640 F.2d 618 (5th Cir.1981);  Savoie v. Lafourche Boat Rentals, Inc., 627 F.2d 722 (5th Cir.1980);  Tri-State Oil Tool Indus., Inc. v. Delta Marine Drilling Co., 410 F.2d 178 (5th Cir.1969).  This right is not extinguished where, as in this case, the shipowner is apportioned part of the fault.  Rather, that shipowner remains entitled to contribution from the third-party tortfeasor in proportion to the third-party's fault.  Adams, 640 F.2d at 620-21.\n\n\n9\nAccordingly, but for Liberty's settlement with the seaman, there would have been no dispute that Herndon had a right to reimbursement of part of the maintenance and cure.  At issue is the effect, vel non, that the settlement has on that right.\n\n\n10\nLiberty notes correctly this circuit's general rule against claims for contribution by non-settling tortfeasors against settling tortfeasors.  Hardy v. Gulf Oil Corp., 949 F.2d 826, 835-36 (5th Cir.1992).  However, in Bertram, our court distinguished the traditional joint tortfeasor settlement case from maintenance and cure reimbursement claims, and held that a settlement by a third-party tortfeasor with an injured seaman does not bar a claim by the seaman's employer for recovery over against that tortfeasor for maintenance and cure.\n\n\n11\nIn Bertram, an employee of Energy Catering Services was injured on a drilling platform while returning to the barge on which he worked.  Houma was a contractor on the platform, which was owned by Freeport.  The employee's several claims included one against his employer, Energy, for maintenance and cure, and one against Freeport and Houma for negligence.  Prior to trial, the employee settled with all parties, leaving, inter alia, Energy's cross-claims against Freeport and Houma for maintenance and cure reimbursement.  The district court found Energy to be without fault, and apportioned fault for Houma at 20%, Freeport at 20%, and the employee at 60%.  It ordered Houma and Freeport to each reimburse Energy 50% of the maintenance and cure, not just their portion of fault (20% each).  Houma appealed, contending, inter alia, that its settlement with Bertram should have barred recovery over by Energy for maintenance and cure.2\n\n\n12\nIn affirming, we held that Adams (1981) and Savoie (1980) were still binding precedent, notwithstanding the modern trend toward proportional fault.  Therefore, we reaffirmed that an employer's claim for recovery over for maintenance and cure is separate and distinct from an injured seaman's claim for damages.  Bertram, 35 F.3d at 1017-18.   Accordingly, we concluded that the general settlement rule in Hardy, a case that did not involve maintenance and cure, was not applicable.  Id. at 1015.   Similarly, we concluded that the Eighth Circuit's opinion in Associated Electric, although dealing with a reimbursement claim for maintenance and cure payments, missed\n\n\n13\nthe critical distinction--long recognized in this circuit--between an employer's right to recover maintenance and cure payments, and one tortfeasor's right to recover some or all of a damage award assessed against it from another tortfeasor.\n\n\n14\nId. at 1017.\n\n\n15\nAs is well-known, maritime law provides two separate lines of recovery for an injured seaman:  damages, and maintenance and cure.  The seaman may claim maintenance and cure only from its employer;  but, as noted, the employer may recover all, or a portion, of those payments from a third-party tortfeasor.  See Adams, 640 F.2d at 620-21 (allowing recovery of proportionate share when employer partially at fault);  Savoie, 627 F.2d at 724 (allowing total recovery when employer not at fault).  The obligation of an employer to pay maintenance and cure, which is based on its employment relationship with the seaman, exists regardless of the fault, vel non, of the employer.  E.g., Aguilar v. Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey, 318 U.S. 724, 730, 63 S.Ct. 930, 934, 87 L.Ed. 1107 (1943);  Bertram, 35 F.3d at 1012-13;  Brister v. A.W.I., Inc., 946 F.2d 350, 361 (5th Cir.1991).\n\n\n16\nAs noted, in addition to maintenance and cure, an injured seaman may also seek damages for negligence and unseaworthiness.  E.g., Cooper v. Diamond M Co., 799 F.2d 176, 179 (5th Cir.1986), cert. denied, 481 U.S. 1048, 107 S.Ct. 2177, 95 L.Ed.2d 834 (1987).  The damage claim may be brought against the employer and a third-party tortfeasor.  In turn, through indemnity or contribution, the employer may recover from the third-party tortfeasor for part or all of any damages assessed against the employer.  See, Loose v. Offshore Navigation, Inc., 670 F.2d 493, 499-500 (5th Cir.1982).  Thus, in a maritime collision, a third-party tortfeasor faces two distinct claims by a shipowner for contribution or indemnity:  (1) for damages assessed against the shipowner;  and (2) for maintenance and cure.  As stated, Bertram holds that a settlement by the third-party with an injured seaman on the damage claim will not bar the shipowner's recovery of maintenance and cure.\n\n\n17\nThe holding in Bertram controls here, even though Herndon, unlike the employer in Bertram, was found partially at fault.  As noted, our court held in Adams that the partial fault of the shipowner does not preclude recovery for maintenance and cure from a joint tortfeasor for its portion of the fault.  Because Herndon and Liberty were found 25% and 75% at fault, respectively, Herndon has a claim against Liberty for 75% of the maintenance and cure.3  See Bertram, 35 F.3d at 1020-21.\n\n\n18\nFinally, as to any concern over the policy of favoring settlements, once it is recognized that Liberty in fact had two separate grounds of liability to the shipowner/employer, it becomes clear that settlement policy is not implicated.  Liberty cannot extinguish its maintenance and cure liability to Herndon (a separate and independent claim) by settling a separate and unrelated claim with the injured seamen.  As discussed in Bertram, 35 F.3d at 1016-17, public policy favoring settlements should be advanced by Bertram's holding, because settlement of all damages and maintenance and cure claims will be fostered, resulting in the possible termination of all claims, and, hence, the litigation.\n\nIII.\n\n19\nFor the foregoing reasons the judgment of the district court is REVERSED, and this case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n20\nREVERSED and REMANDED.\n\n\n\n1\n In response to Liberty's Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss Herndon's maintenance and cure reimbursement claim, Herndon stated that it had paid approximately $105,000\n\n\n2\n One of the other issues was whether Houma was required to pay 50% of the maintenance and cure, even though it was only 20% at fault.  Bound by precedent concerning an innocent (without fault) employer, we held that it was.  Savoie, 627 F.2d at 724\n\n\n3\n As noted, in the limitation action, the district court found the crews of both vessels at fault.  Liberty's crew was found 75% at fault for, among other things, failing to properly anchor and control their vessel.  Herndon's crew was found 25% at fault for failing to keep a proper lookout\n\n\n", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "FreeLaw"}}
{"text": "INTRODUCTION {#s1}\n============\n\nDigestive malignancies, especially gastric cancer, colorectal cancer and esophageal cancer, are rampant in several countries around the world. Colorectal cancer, as one of the most common digestive malignancies, is occupying the fourth in diagnosed cancer and in the second place of leading death of patients with cancer in the United States \\[[@R1]\\]. In 2015, it is estimated that about five thousands of people will die of CRC \\[[@R1], [@R2]\\]. Colorectal cancer was reported the third most frequently found malignancy, with male incidence of percentage 12.3 and female 13.1% \\[[@R3], [@R4]\\]. Additionally, in spite of the early detection with endoscopic screening in North America, CRC is in the third places in most common cause of cancer-related deaths, including both of patients who underwent operation or not \\[[@R5]\\].\n\nAt present, several advances have been made in the treatment approaches, imaging techniques and staging procedures. However, in spite of advanced instruments like electronic gastroscope and electron colonoscopy which could early detect digestive lesion, there were still approximately 20% of patients finding to be metastatic when they were diagnosed \\[[@R6], [@R7]\\]. Therefore, further appropriate prognostic bio-markers are required to predict the prognosis of patients who underwent operation and their clinical status of tumor, then to guide the doctor to give more attention to patient who may experience poor prognosis.\n\nIn recent years, increasing number of studies have reported that the expression of cyclin B1 may be correlated with the poor outcome of patients with various cancers, including breast carcinoma \\[[@R8]\\], prostatic cancer \\[[@R9]\\], pancreatic malignancy \\[[@R10]\\], lung carcinoma \\[[@R11]\\], laryngeal cancer \\[[@R12]\\] as well as hepatocellular cancer \\[[@R13]\\], gastric cancer (GC) \\[[@R14]--[@R17]\\], colorectal cancer \\[[@R18]--[@R21]\\] and esophageal cancer (EC) \\[[@R22]--[@R25]\\]. However, the conclusions of these studies was still incongruent, for some studies drawing unsupported conclusions \\[[@R18], [@R19]\\]. Therefore, the present meta-analysis on the basis of relevant studies were conducted to analyze and assess the prognostic value and clinical significance of high or positive expression of cyclin B1, as well as its association with characteristics, in patients with three main digestive cancers, including gastric cancer, colorectal cancer and esophageal cancer.\n\nRESULTS {#s2}\n=======\n\nIncluded studies and characteristics {#s2_1}\n------------------------------------\n\nAfter 34 studies were excluded according to our including criteria, eventually a total of 12 articles (2080 patients) were included for analysis and evaluation, of which 11 articles \\[[@R14]--[@R20], [@R22]--[@R25]\\] including 1971 patients were included for analyzing the correlation of positive/high expression of cyclin B1 and OS, 9 studies \\[[@R15]--[@R17], [@R19], [@R21]--[@R25]\\] including 1253 participants for analyzing the correlation between cyclin B1 and clinicopathological features (Figure [1](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}). The excluding reasons were as follows: 32 studies for lack of available data; 1 study \\[[@R26]\\] for the definition of positive/high expression did not meet our including criteria; 1 study \\[[@R27]\\] was just a review article with no available data. Of the included studies, six were conducted in Japan, three in China, each one in Brazil, Germany and Korea. The sample sizes ranged from 23 to 482 patients. Each four studies were about gastric, colorectal and esophageal cancer. Patients in nine studies were treated with surgery, two treated with adjuvant therapy like chemotherapy, radiotherapy or chemo-radiotherapy, apart from surgery (Table [1](#T1){ref-type=\"table\"}).\n\n![Flow diagram following the PRISMA template of the search strategy for expression of cyclin B1 in patients with cancer](oncotarget-08-96373-g001){#F1}\n\n###### The

relationship of positive/high cyclin B1 expression with 3-year overall survival in patients with digestive cancer. The pooled results showed no significance for positive/high expression of cyclin B1 predicting the 3-year overall survival of patients(OR 0.70; 95% CI 0.33--1.51; *P* = 0.36) (Figure [2](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}).\n\n![Forest plot for the association between positive/high expression of cyclin B1 and 3-year overall survival (OS) of overall types of cancer](oncotarget-08-96373-g002){#F2}\n\nThe correlation between cyclin B1 expression and 5-year OS {#s2_4}\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nTen studies reported the association between positive/high expression of cyclin B1 and 5-year OS, of which four were about patients with esophageal cancer \\[[@R22]--[@R25]\\], four about gastric cancer \\[[@R14]--[@R17]\\] and two about colorectal cancer \\[[@R18], [@R19]\\]. The combined result indicated that the high/positive expression of cyclin B1did not significant correlate with 5-year OS of digestive cancer patients (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.30--1.06; *P* = 0.07) (Figure [3](#F3){ref-type=\"fig\"}).\n\n![Forest plot for the association between positive/high expression of cyclin B1 and 5-year overall survival (OS) of overall types of cancer](oncotarget-08-96373-g003){#F3}\n\nThe correlation between cyclin B1 expression and 3-year OS of EC, GC and CRC {#s2_5}\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nConsidering no significance in overall types of the three digestive cancers, we performed subgroup analysis according to gastric carcinoma (GC), colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and esophageal carcinoma (EC). The positive/high expression of cyclin B1 had an obvious association with 3-year OS in patients with esophageal cancer according to the pooled results (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.12--0.37; *P* \\< 0.00001) (Figure [4](#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}). It revealed that esophageal cancer patients with positive/high expression of cyclin B1 had worse prognosis. However, no significant association between cyclin B1 and prognosis of patients with gastric cancer and colorectal cancer was found in our analysis.\n\n![Forest plot for the association between positive/high expression of cyclin B1 and 3-year overall survival (OS) of esophageal cancer](oncotarget-08-96373-g004){#F4}\n\nThe correlation between cyclin B1 expression and 5-year OS of EC, GC and CRC {#s2_6}\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLikewise, we also estimated the correlation between cyclin B1 expression and 5-year OS of esophageal carcinoma (EC), gastric carcinoma (GC) and colorectal carcinoma (CRC) by subgroup analysis. We used fixed effect models because of no significant heterogeneity between studies. Our results showed statistically significant correlation between positive/high expression of cyclin B1 and 5-year OS of patients with EC and CRC, with the pooled OR being 0.20 \\[95% CI 0.12--0.34; *P* \\< 0.00001\\] and 2.01 \\[95% CI 1.32--3.08; *P* = 0.001\\], respectively (Figures [5](#F5){ref-type=\"fig\"} and [6](#F6){ref-type=\"fig\"}). However, interestingly, patients with positive/high expression of cyclin B1 had worse prognosis in patients with esophageal carcinoma, but better prognosis in patients with colorectal carcinoma.

However, for 5-year OS of all types of cancer, three particular studies, Fang et al. 2015 \\[[@R18]\\], Grabsch et al. 2004 \\[[@R19]\\] and Kim et al. 2007 \\[[@R16]\\], significantly affected the pooled results. The pooled ORs respectively changed from 0.56 \\[95% CI 0.30, 1.06\\] to 0.45 \\[95% CI 0.25, 0.81\\], 0.48 \\[95% CI 0.25, 0.93\\] and 0.50 \\[95% CI 0.26, 0.95\\] after excluding each of them from the meta-analysis seriatim. The pooled results of 3 and 5-year OS of esophageal cancer and colorectal cancer had high stability as well. No single study was found significantly affecting heterogeneity between studies.\n\nThe funnel plots showed no obvious evidence of publication bias with regard to the effects on 3 and 5-year OS (Figures [7](#F7){ref-type=\"fig\"} and [8](#F8){ref-type=\"fig\"}).\n\n![Funnel plots for detecting publication bias of the association between positive/high expression of cyclin B1 and 3-year overall survival (OS) of overall types of cancer](oncotarget-08-96373-g007){#F7}\n\n![Funnel plots for detecting publication bias of the association between positive/high expression of cyclin B1 and 5-year overall survival (OS) of overall types of cancer](oncotarget-08-96373-g008){#F8}\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS {#s3}\n==========================\n\nIt has been implicated that high expression of cyclin B1, to a certain extent, may impede the autogenous controlling of cell growth and lead to a malignant phenotype \\[[@R28]\\]. The adjustion of cell cycle progression is strongly necessary for cells to keep gene integration which is very critical for cell survival. According to current research, cyclin B1 is one of a family of proteins varying in their expression levels during the cell proliferation cycle \\[[@R29]--[@R32]\\]. Cyclin B1 has various roles in cell proliferation cycle, including cell differentiation, cell apoptosis, and the (tumor cell) distant metastasis \\[[@R33]--[@R37]\\]. Increasing proofs have indicated that the important protein was high or over expressed in laryngeal cancer \\[[@R12]\\], prostate cancer \\[[@R9]\\], pancreatic carcinoma \\[[@R10]\\], lung carcinoma \\[[@R11]\\], breast carcinoma \\[[@R8]\\], hepatocellular cancer \\[[@R13]\\], esophageal cancer, gastric cancer and colorectal cancer \\[[@R15], [@R20], [@R23], [@R24]\\]. Murakami H et al. reported that the cyclin B1 prevalently expressed in patients with tumor deeper invasion than superficial invasion \\[[@R25]\\]. Song Y.M et al. suggested that the protein result in tumor distant metastasis likely via accelerate a transition of epithelial to mesenchyma \\[[@R29]\\]. The study from Wang A. et al. showed much higher expression of the protein in human colorectal carcinomas than did the non-neoplastic mucosa \\[[@R26]\\]. Besides, previous studies have also compared the different significance of positive cyclin B1 expression in nuclear and cytoplasm, and testified that the protein expression, especially nuclear dominant expression, can be significant as a prognostic indicator in esophageal cancer \\[[@R24]\\]. However, the detailed role and mechanism of cyclin B1 in prognosis of cancer patients was not clear. What\\'s more, their results still remained inconsistent. The findings from Fang Y. et al. suggested that cyclin B1 could control the invasion and distant metastasis of colorectal cancer cells \\[[@R18]\\], which was opposite to with other studies \\[[@R14]--[@R16], [@R20]\\]. Besides, according to Grabsch\\'s results, though this protein was frequently and early expression in malignancies, it did not predict the prognosis and recurrence risk for patients \\[[@R19]\\]. Considering all kinds of discrepancies above, further study was needed to unitize the different voice.\n\nWe perform the present analysis to demonstrate the significance of cyclin B1 expression for the survival of patients with digestive malignancies. Exceptionally, results of the present analysis did not remarkable support the consequence that high or elevated cyclin B1 expression was significantly correlated with the prognosis in all types of digestive cancer. However, surprisingly, we found the prominent pertinence between the high/over-expression of cyclin B1 and esophageal cancer or colorectal cancer. In esophageal cancer, cyclin B1 positive/high expression had an evident association with both 3-year OS (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.12--0.37; *P* \\< 0.00001) (Figure [4](#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}) and 5-year OS (OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.12--0.34; *P* \\< 0.00001) (Figure [5](#F5){ref-type=\"fig\"}). The pooled OR was 2.01 \\[95% CI 1.32--3.08; *P*=0.001\\] in colorectal cancer (Figure [6](#F6){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Interestingly, though the significance was found both in esophageal cancer and colorectal cancer, it was a contrary clinical result. According to the results, patients with cyclin B1 positive/high expression experienced a poor prognosis and low 3 or 5-year OS in esophageal cancer, but high 5-year OS in patients with colorectal cancer, which was consistent with the study of Korenaga D et al. 2002 \\[[@R21]\\]. Ye C et al. \\[[@R27]\\] came to the same conclusion in esophageal carcinoma and colonic or rectal carcinoma. The reason for this inconsistent results may be the different expression modes of cyclin B1 in different tissue types of tumor. In addition, we also estimated association between elevated cyclin B1 expression and clinicopathological features. In the overall pooled analysis, the results suggested that cyclin B1 positive/high expression was statistically correlated with size of tumor lesions (OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.38, 0.93) and distant Metastasis (OR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.13, 0.71), but not with other clinicopathological features such as gender, grade, Pathologic T, Pathologic N, Blood vessel invasion and Histologic type in the patients with digestive cancer. According to the study of Yasuda M et al. 2002, tumors tissue in which cyclin B1 expressing were prevalent in gerontal patients, in better differentiation and swelling-growth tumors, but was lower expression in poorly differentiated and invasive-growth tumor. The subgroup analysis they performed in study indicated that tumor histological type was one of remarkable factors relating to cyclin B1 protein expression \\[[@R17]\\]. In subgroup analysis of 3 and 5-year OS, the results indicated that positive/high cyclin B1 expression was prominently correlated with 3-year OS of patients with stage I--III (OR 0.25; 95% CI 0.11, 0.58; *P* = 0.001) and 5-year OS of patients with stage I--III (OR 0.23; 95% CI 0.11, 0.48; *P* \\< 0.0001) and TNM stage *P* \\< 0.05 (OR 0.32; 95% CI 0.13, 0.76; *P*=0.010), but not in other subgroups. According to the results from sensitivity analysis, we found that the study from Fang et al. 2015, Grabsch et al. 2004 and Kim et al. 2007 \\[[@R16], [@R18], [@R19]\\] had significant impacts on the pooled results. When the studies above was got rid from the analysis lists, the pooled OR became 0.45 \\[95% CI 0.25, 0.81\\], 0.48 \\[95% CI 0.25, 0.93\\] and 0.50 \\[95% CI 0.26, 0.95\\] for 5-year OS.\n\nHowever, several limitations existed in thsi meta-analysis. One of the main deficiencies was the inconformity of the cut-off values (definition of positive/high expression of cyclin B1). The cut-off values ranged from 4.6% to 20%, but the majority of studies used 10%. The cut-off values may directly affect the results of analysis. In the study of Huang TY et al. 2014 \\[[@R22]\\], they classified the \u2212/+ to negative, ++/+++ to positive to generate the survival curves, but Murakami H et al. regarded 1+ and 2+ as positive \\[[@R25]\\]. Besides, Takeno S et al. 2002 \\[[@R23]\\] suggested that elevated cyclin B1 expression was correlated remarkablely with a poor prognosis in patients with esophageal cancer when the cut-off value for positivity was set at 20% (*P* \\< 0.0001). Indeed, cut-off values of \\> 30%, \\> 40%, and \\> 50% also were correlated significantly with patient outcome, with values of *P* \\< 0.0001. However, the 10% cut-off value did not reach statistical significance (*P* = 0.075) \\[[@R23]\\]. The second deficiency was the extensive changes of patients' clinical stages, because the outcome or survival of cancer patients was affected by their clinical stages to a great degree. Indeed, according to our results, patients with stage I--III who had high/positive cyclin B1 expression had poor 3 or 5-year OS. Besides, we also found that distant metastasis was significantly associated with positive/high expression of cyclin B1, but to combine the results, we regarded stage 0--III as no metastasis and IV as distant metastasis in study of Murakami H et al. 1999 \\[[@R25]\\]. In addition, in the study of Nozoe T et al. 2002 \\[[@R24]\\], because of only 1, 3 and 5-year survival rate were given, we converted them to the survival number of patients to make the pooled analysis, which may lead to some bias. Finally, the prognosis were also affected by many of other composite factors, such as tumor histological type, accepting adjuvant therapy or not, patients age, tumor size and venous involvement or not, which should also be taken into consideration.\n\nConsidering the limitations above, further research with different clinical stages should be designed to clear the association between positive/high expression of cyclin B1 and prognosis of patients. In addition, further studies should demonstrate which one should be regarded as the optimal cut-off value of cyclin B1 expression for predicting the prognosis of patients with digestive cancer.\n\nIn conclusion, according to the present analysis, we could cautiously come to the conclusion that positive/high expression of cyclin B1 may associate with poor prognosis in patients with esophageal cancer, but better prognosis in patients with colorectal cancer, with consideration of the evident statistical significance. In addition, cyclin B1 expression may be associated with size of tumor and distant metastasis. Elevated cyclin B1 expression may be used as one of prognostic indicators for early identification of poor prognosis for patients with digestive cancer.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS {#s4}\n=====================\n\nCriteria for considering studies of this meta-analysis {#s4_1}\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe including criteria: (1) Immumohistochemical staining of cyclin B1 with surgical specimens; (2) Included people with a pathological diagnosis of EC, GC or CRC; (3) All of randomized, controlled trials (RCTs), observational prospective or retrospective studies were included; (4) Definition of positive/high expression of cyclin B1 was reported; (5) The outcomes including overall survival was reported; (6) Sufficient data (number of cyclin B1 positive patients and their characteristics) were provided.\n\nExcluding criteria: (1) Studies about animals; (2) Non-research studies such as expert opinions, letters, editorials, reviews and case reports; (3) Studies whose participants complicated with other primary tumors; (4) Studies without sufficient data; (5) The definition of positive/high expression of cyclin B1 (cut-off value) was not given or did not meet our including criteria.\n\nTypes of objective measures {#s4_2}\n---------------------------\n\nThe primary objective was the association between cyclin B1 high/positive expression and 3-year OS or 5-year OS.\n\nThe secondary objective was the association between cyclin B1 high/positive expression and clinical features including Age, Gender, Size of tumor, Histologic type, Pathologic T, Pathologic N, distant metastasis, Blood vessel invasion, Lymphatic vessel invasion and clinical TNM stage.\n\nSearch strategy {#s4_3}\n---------------\n\nDatabase of PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Web of Science were searched online to January, 2017. Our searching terms and procedures were as follows: (1)\"cyclin B1\"; (2) \"esophageal cancer\" OR \"esophageal carcinoma\" OR \"esophageal tumor\"; (3) \"gastric cancer\" OR \"gastric carcinoma\" OR \"gastric tumor\"; (4) \"colorectal cancer\" OR \"colorectal carcinoma\" OR \"colorectal tumor\"; (5) \"prognosis\" OR \"survival\" OR \"outcome\". Search strategy was: 1 AND (2 OR 3 OR 4) AND 5. Two researchers independently screened the titles and abstracts of each study. Then full text will be obtained for further evaluation if one get our including criteria.\n\nQuality assessment {#s4_4}\n------------------\n\nWe used the 9-star Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) \\[[@R38]\\] to assess the quality of all included studies, and the total scores of each study were displayed in the characteristics table (Table [1](#T1){ref-type=\"table\"}). Three aspects of NOS of evaluation, including selection, comparability, and outcome between the case group and control group were offered for scoring. We consider studies with the scores \u2265 6 as high-quality.\n\nData extraction {#s4_5}\n---------------\n\nData for the analysis were extracted independently by two reviewers. When there was disagreement during the selection process, it was resolved by discussion. The extracted contents including study demographics, published years, country, tumor location, treatment, follow-up time, definition of positive/high expression, age, gender, size of tumor, histologic type, pathologic T, pathologic N, distant metastasis, blood vessel invasion, lymphatic vessel invasion and clinical stage were extracted using a standardized form. Data collected were input into RevMan 5.2 software for analysis \\[[@R39]\\].\n\nStatistical analysis {#s4_6}\n--------------------\n\nIn the present analysis, the prognostic value of cyclin B1 expression in patients with digestive cancer was measured by estimating the Odds Ratio (OR) between high/positive expression of cyclin B1 groups and low/negative expression of cyclin B1 groups. The associated 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) were also measured. The heterogeneity between studies was evaluated with *P* value and *I^2^*. *I^2^* \u2265 50% or *P \u2264* 0.10 was deemed to represent significant heterogeneity \\[[@R40], [@R41]\\], and pooled OR was estimated using a Random-effect model. On the contrary, if statistical study heterogeneity was not observed (I^2^ \u2264 50% and *P* \u2265 0.10), a fixed effects model was used. The association between the expression of cyclin B1 and clinical characteristics of patients was evaluated in the same way. For the pooled OR estimates of OS, we performed subgroup analysis by Clinical stage (I--IV vs. I--III), *P* value of TNM stage (*P* \\< 0.05 vs. *P* \\> 0.05) and Cut-off value (10% vs. \u2264 5%). Besides, we performed sensitivity analysis to examine the stability of the combined results and to identify the source of heterogeneity. Finally, Begg\\'s and Egger\\'s test were used to assess the publication bias. No obvious publication bias was detected, if the shape of funnel plots revealed no obvious asymmetry. All statistical analyses were performed using standard statistical procedures provided in RevMan 5.2 \\[[@R39]\\].\n\nWen-Ping Lian contributed to the study design, data analysis and quality assessment.

Now, Australian-based enterprise software firm, Atlassian, has announced its own version for the enterprise, Confluence Questions 1.0.\n\nInitially launched as a beta version last September, which has since been trialled by Atlassian customers, including Boeing and Dow Jones, Confluence Questions 1.0 is team documentation collaboration add-on for Confluence that allows enable teams or entire companies to share their questions and answers in a central internal location.\n\nConfluence group product manager Bill Arconati described the platform as \"Quora for your enterprise where it's a platform that gives employees one place to ask questions and quickly get answers\".\n\nArconati said the Q&A software addresses the main problem companies currently face, which is company knowledge management.\n\n\"Often once a question gets answered the answer goes nowhere; it's not reported or made searchable for future generations to benefit from. There is no knowledge capture or value created,\" he said.\n\n\"Meanwhile, the people with the knowledge get bombarded with the same questions over and over again, and if they ever leave the company the knowledge goes out the door with them.\"\n\nArconati said users have the opportunity to pose questions based on topics to have them answered by experts within the company in different formats including images, videos, tweets, code snippets, and text. They also have the chance to opt-in and self-identify themselves as experts of other topics.\n\n\"People can answer and get multiple answers. You can also, through the wisdom of the crowd, ensure the best quality answer rises to the top and then all of that is searchable later through Confluence like your company intranet and have all your knowledge in one place,\" he said.\n\nAccording to Arconati, Confluence Questions 1.0 is the first step for the company in developing knowledge sharing for enterprises.\n\n\"This is the beginning; we have a broader vision for knowledge sharing where we want to allow Q&A to be like googling the minds of your employees, so we have pretty big ambitions there. There is a lot of room to get a lot of knowledge through employees and this is our first step on that,\" he said.\n\nSince completing a degree in journalism, Aimee has had her fair share of covering various topics, including business, retail, manufacturing, and travel.

{"text": "Discourse 26: The Eighth Chapter Concludes \u2013 The Journey of the Soul After Death\n\nThe Eighth Chapter of the Bhagavadgita deals with the subject of life after death. The Puranas, the Upanishads, the Yoga Vasishtha and the Bhagavadgita contain many varieties of descriptions of the condition of the soul after it leaves this body. The Puranas, especially, go into a detailed, lurid description of the condition in which the soul finds itself\u2014particularly if it has not done any merit, or if the merit it has done is so negligible that the wrongs it has committed outweigh the good or are on an equal footing with it.\n\nThe stories in the Garuda Purana and such other scriptures, even in the Bhagavata, are really frightening. When the soul departs from the body in the case of these lower, unpurified and negligibly religious souls, it is taken away by the messengers of Yama and placed before the Lord of Death for judgment.\n\nIt is said that Yama asks the soul, \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d\n\nOrdinarily, it cannot remember anything. It will say, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nThe shock of separation from the body removes all memory, and it cannot remember what it has done in the previous life. It is said that then a hot rod, called a yamadanda, is kept on its head, and immediately it remembers its entire past. It knows every detail of the actions that it did, both good and bad.\n\nThe soul says, \u201cI have done a little good, but have also made many mistakes and performed so many erroneous actions.\u201d\n\nYama asks, \u201cWhat do you have to say about it now?\u201d\n\nThe soul replies, \u201cI have got relatives. They will expiate them for me. They will conduct yajnas, charities, worship, sankirtans, bhajans and meditations in my name, and I shall be free from the consequence of the sins that I have committed or the mistakes that I have made.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo then!\u201d says Yama, \u201cAnd see what they do.\u201d\n\nApparently, it takes ten days for the soul to be brought back, so some ceremony is usually done on the tenth, eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth days. The soul hovers around, observing what the relatives are doing, and Yama\u2019s messengers stand behind like policemen to see what is done. If an expiatory ceremony is done in the name of the soul, such as the Bhagavata Saptaham, the Rudra Yaga, the Narayana Bali and the Vishnu Yajna, and varieties of charities are done, and all those things that were dear to the soul are also given in gift, the effect of these good deeds is credited to the account of the soul and it is exonerated to that extent.\n\nBut suppose this is not done and, like modern boys, the relatives do not believe in these observances: \u201cIf our father died, let it go, that\u2019s all. We won\u2019t bother about it,\u201d and there is no charity, no goodwill, and they behave as if nothing has happened; or, they do not even believe that something happens after death because they think that there is no life after death. If that is the case, the soul is dragged back. When the policemen know that someone is a culprit, and it is confirmed, they deal with him very severely. If they know that he is going to be released and nothing is going to happen to him, they do not bother much about it. But if his relatives have done nothing, it is certain that he is going to be punished, so for one year they drag the soul to the kingdom of the Lord of Death. At first they brought it within ten days because they wanted to know what was happening. When it is certain that it is going to be punished, they drag it, pull it, scratch and beat it, and it will be hungry and thirsty and bleeding. That is why another ceremony is done after one year; it takes one year for the soul to return to the abode of Yama. The varshika (annual) ceremony is very important. If nothing has been done on the tenth to thirteenth days after the passing of the soul, at least something should be done on the anniversary so that some mercy may be granted by Lord Yama before the sentence is passed.\n\nIf the soul has no merit at all, it will be sent to the land of punishment, whatever the punishment be. In the Srimad Bhagavata Mahapurana, the Garuda Purana, etc., the type of punishment and difficulties that the soul has to undergo are described in such gory language that we would not like to be born into this world again.\n\nWhen the soul is expunged of all its sins by suffering in the prison of Yama\u2019s hell, it is released. It is said that then it is sent to Rudraloka, and will not be allowed to leave. To release the soul from Rudra\u2019s clutches, Rudra Yajna is done. Then it is sent to Vaikuntha, so Vishnu Yajna is done; and after many, many years, the soul attains moksha. This is how a bad person gets purified in a very painful way, and then finally attains blessedness.\n\nOr, if the soul has a tremendous attachment to relations and to wealth, it can be reborn into this world. A Muslim gentleman lived near a house in which a Hindu family had a little baby. The baby was very beautiful. The Muslim wanted to fondle it, sit it on his lap, but the Hindus would not allow the Muslim to touch the baby, which greatly disturbed him. The child grew up, and then the Muslim died. This child, which had grown up, started talking in Persian.\n\nThey asked, \u201cWhat is this matter? Who are you?\u201d\n\nHe replied, \u201cI am that Muslim gentleman who wanted to caress this child, and you didn\u2019t allow it; and now I am possessing it!\u201d\n\nThis is the effect of attachments. And very intense attachments, which do not even give the soul time to take birth in this world, convert it into a ghost. Preta yoni is the outcome and, as described in the Bhagavata Purana, it hovers around in space, hungry and thirsty.\n\nHere the Bhagavadgita describes the more glorious paths to the higher realms. Those who are not spiritually awakened but have done immensely good deeds reach a lower kingdom called Chandraloka, the realm of the moon, where they stay invisibly and enjoy the fruit of their good deeds. When the momentum of their good deeds, charitable deeds, etc., is exhausted, they come back into this world. But if a person is spiritually awakened and is not merely a good man\u2014not merely a charitable or a philanthropic person\u2014then the path is different. These two paths are called the northern path and the southern path.\n\nYatra k\u0101le tvan\u0101v\u1e5bttim \u0101v\u1e5btti\u1e41 caiva yogina\u1e25, pray\u0101t\u0101 y\u0101nti ta\u1e41 k\u0101la\u1e41 vak\u1e63y\u0101mi bharatar\u1e63abha (8.23): \u201cI shall now tell you,\u201d says Bhagavan Sri Krishna, \u201cabout that path treading which one returns, and that path treading which one does not return. These two paths I shall describe to you now\u2014uttaramarga or jyotirmarga, and dakshinamarga or dhumamarga, as they are called.\u201d\n\nAgnir jotir aha\u1e25 \u015bukla\u1e25 \u1e63a\u1e47m\u0101s\u0101 uttar\u0101ya\u1e47am, tatra pray\u0101t\u0101 gacchanti brahma brahmavido jan\u0101\u1e25 (8.24): Everything is filled with light, everything is filled with divinity, and everything is superintended over by a divinity. The fire of cremation\u2014that is the agni, the physical fire, which has a divinity of its own\u2014assumes a divine form in the case of a person who is to rise up to the celestial realms. Then there is a divinity superintending over the daytime, in contrast with the night. If a person passes away during the daytime, and during the bright half of the lunar month, and during the northern movement of the sun, he shall reach the solar orb\u2014Suryaloka. From there, he will be taken up further.\n\nThe Upanishads describe many more stages than the ones mentioned here. And at a particular stage beyond the sun, a superhuman entity is supposed to come and take the soul by the hand. Up to the solar orb, or even a little beyond, is called the realm of lightning. That is, beyond the sun, the lightning of Brahmaloka flashes forth. The individuality consciousness of the soul slowly gets diminished at that time, and it is not aware of any self-effort. It does not know that it is moving at all, inasmuch as the ego is almost gone. It is said that at that time an amanava purusha deputed by Brahma himself comes down in a luminous form, and leads the soul to the abode of Brahma, the Creator. This is the path of krama mukti, or gradual liberation, in which the soul is supposed to be glorying in Brahmaloka until Brahma himself is dissolved at the end of time\u2014at the end of a hundred years of his life\u2014and then the Absolute Brahman is reached.\n\nBut there is a possibility of immediate salvation without passing through all these stages\u2014a hundredfold promotion, as it were. It is the dissolution of the soul in the supreme Brahman at this very spot. The soul need not have to travel in space and time because it is a jivanmukta purusha, one who has attained to a consciousness where there is no distance to be travelled. For him, there is no solar orb or anything else. He has spread his consciousness everywhere, in all beings: sarvabh\u016btahite rat\u0101\u1e25 (12.4). He is the soul of all beings, like Suka Maharishi, Vyasa, Vasishtha, etc. When his soul spreads itself everywhere in the cosmos, where is the question of moving? Na tasya pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101 utkr\u0101manti (B.U. 4.4.6): His pranas do not depart, as is the case of other people. Brahmaiva san brahm\u0101pyeti: They dissolve here, just now. That is, the moment the soul departs the body, it enters the supreme Brahman, the Absolute, then and there, without having to pass through all these stages. But in the case of krama mukti, the graduated steps mentioned in the Bhagavadgita, it is different.\n\nThe divinity of fire, the divinity of daytime, the divinity of the lunar month\u2019s bright half, and the divinity ruling over the northern movement of the sun will take care of the soul and bring it up. In the Moksha Parva of the Mahabharata there is the story of a great ascetic who rose up from his body, and a little flame rising up through the sky could be seen. It rose higher and higher until it reached the orb of the sun, where a divine being emerged from the solar orb and received it. According to our tradition, the sun is not a material substance. It is a divinity\u2014hiranmaya purusha\u2014in which a golden-coloured Narayana is seated. Just as a human being is not a body, the sun is also not a body; and just as we see only the body of a person and do not see what the person is on the inside, we do not see divinity of the sun. We see only its outer appearance, which we call helium, atomic energy, etc., in just the same way as we call a person bone and flesh, nerves, blood, etc.\u2014which is not a correct description. So there is something beyond the human concept here. Divinities are everywhere in the cosmos, in every atom, which is also controlled and enveloped by the universal God. If God is everywhere, why should He not be in every atom and in everything? In the case of such a realisation, there is immediate dissolution.\n\nDh\u016bmo r\u0101tris tath\u0101 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25 \u1e63a\u1e47m\u0101s\u0101 dak\u1e63i\u1e47\u0101yanam, tatra c\u0101ndramasa\u1e41 jyotir yog\u012b pr\u0101pya nivartate (8.25). There are those who have not spiritually awakened themselves, have not done spiritual meditation, and have an insufficient devotion to God. Even if they are very good people, highly charitable and humanistic in their approach, they will not be allowed to move along this northern path to the sun. They will not go to Brahmaloka. They will go to a lower realm, called Chandraloka. The smoke which rises from the fire during cremation will be their guiding principle. The dark half of the lunar month, and the southern movement of the sun, signify a deficiency in divine powers and a lesser chance of the soul going up along the path of brightness. It will reach Chandraloka, where it will enjoy the fruits of the good deeds it has done. Whatever good deeds were done will have their effect. Every action produces a reaction. Any good, charitable deed will bring the soul an abundance of joy in Chandraloka; but the soul will come back, because anyone who has not realised the universality of God will come back. Only a soul who is totally devoted to God will gradually pass through these stages of divine ordinances to the Ultimate Being. But if we are united with God here itself, we will immediately merge into God.\n\n\u015auklak\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47e gat\u012b hyete jagata\u1e25 \u015b\u0101\u015bvate mate (8.26). Broadly speaking, these are two paths of the soul after death. Either we go that way or we go this way, according to our karma and our spiritual status. \u015auklak\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47e gat\u012b hyete jagata\u1e25 \u015b\u0101\u015bvate mate, ekay\u0101 y\u0101ty an\u0101v\u1e5bttim anyay\u0101vartate puna\u1e25: By the one path, one does not come back to this world; by the other path, one returns.\n\nNaite s\u1e5bt\u012b p\u0101rtha j\u0101nan yog\u012b muhyati ka\u015bcana, tasm\u0101t sarve\u1e63u k\u0101le\u1e63u yogayukto bhav\u0101rjuna (8.27). Having known clearly that these are the two paths, who would like to tread the lesser path? \u201cTherefore, be a yogi, O Arjuna, and try to tread the upper path.\u201d Whoever knows the merits and demerits of these two paths will certainly pursue the path of merit rather than the path of demerit. It is the lack of knowledge that prevents us from working for our own salvation. But if we know that such a thing exists, and that even after death our karmas will pursue us wherever we go\u2014that even if we go to the nether regions, we will be caught by the nemesis of our actions, the results of what we have done, because there is a law which punishes us\u2014we will obey the law. And if we know that there are these two paths, and there is a chance of our entering into the lower one, we will certainly work to attain the higher one. Knowing this, we will certainly become wiser and, therefore, work for a state of establishment in yoga\u2014union with the divinities in the various graduated scales of development, or with the Supreme Absolute itself, whatever the case may be. Either way, one will be a supreme yogi who is united with the Absolute now, or one will be a graduated yogi who will move systematically through the stages mentioned. Anyway, knowing this, one will not come to grief. Tasm\u0101t sarve\u1e63u k\u0101le\u1e63u yogayukto bhav\u0101rjuna: \u201cTherefore, become a yogi, Arjuna!\u201d\n\nVede\u1e63u yaj\u00f1e\u1e63u tapa\u1e25su caiva d\u0101ne\u1e63u yat pu\u1e47yaphala\u1e41 pradi\u1e63\u1e6dam, atyeti tat sarvam ida\u1e41 viditv\u0101 yog\u012b para\u1e41 sth\u0101nam upaiti c\u0101dyam (8.28). These discourses that you are hearing now as satsanga\u2014the knowledge of these wonderful things beyond this world that you are gaining\u2014is greater than all the good deeds that you do by way of charity, and all the sacrifices that you perform. All the merits that you will accrue by doing charity, good deeds and even the study of scriptures like the Vedas, and by doing austerity and living an abstemious life will bring you some good results. But this phala of satsanga, the blessing of this highly purifying training that your soul is undergoing by listening to these glorious eternal realities, certainly has a greater capacity to produce an effect than all the charities, studies and scriptures, etc. It transcends even the Vedas, and you attain to that place, that abode, which is the Ancient One. With this, we conclude the Eighth Chapter.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "Pile-CC"}}
{"text": "Q:\n\nServer-side validation localization differs from client-side\n\nWhilst this may concern to other topics as well, I'm just heading the following trouble with validation:\nModel Annotation, Controller and Action\nI use validation attributes from System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations. The model looks like\npublic class NewUserModel\n{\n    [Required]\n    public string Username { get; set; }\n}\n\nSo, nothing special. According to that, a pretty much default controller action\npublic ActionResult New()\n{\n    return View(new NewUserModel());\n}\n\nand the view\n@using (Html.BeginForm())\n{\n    @Html.LabelFor(m => m.Username)\n    @Html.EditorFor(m => m.Username)\n    @Html.ValidationMessageFor(m => m.Username)\n    <button type=\"submit\">save</button>\n}\n\nSetting Culture With Filter\nBased on user preferences, culture is set via following filter\npublic class CultureFilter : IActionFilter\n{\n    public void OnActionExecuting(ActionExecutingContext filterContext)\n    {\n        // simplified for this example\n        Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture = CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo(\"de\");\n    }\n}\n\nwhich is registered in global.asax with\npublic static void RegisterGlobalFilters(GlobalFilterCollection filters)\n{\n    filters.Add(new CultureFilter());\n}\n\nDefault language is english, so the web.config contains\n<globalization culture=\"en-US\" uiCulture=\"en\"/>\n\nWith that done, client-side validation works perfectly. Data attributes for unobtrusive jQuery validation are localized as you can see in the resulting HTML:\n<input data-val=\"true\"\n       data-val-required=\"Das Feld Username ist erforderlich.\"\n       id=\"Username\" name=\"Username\" type=\"text\" value=\"\" />\n\nThe Problem: Server-side Validation Without Localization\nThe trouble is, that forcing server-side validation by disabling JavaScript renders following unlocalized validation message, while the data attribute is still localized:\n<input data-val=\"true\"\n       data-val-required=\"Das Feld Username ist erforderlich.\"\n       id=\"Username\" name=\"Username\" type=\"text\" value=\"\" />\n<span class=\"field-validation-error\" data-valmsg-for=\"Username\"\n      data-valmsg-replace=\"true\">The Username field is required.</span>\n\nLooks pretty funny, doesn't it? ;-)\nWhat Did I Try?\nFirst, I checked if the server-side culture is set by web.config. Yes, it is. If I change the <globalization/> attributes to german cultures (or just remove the node as by system language is german), the server-side validation message is german too.\nThis let me believe there might be a difference in times when server-side and client-side take their messages from resources. And maybe the server-side does it prior to executing the action, which means CultureFilter.OnActionExecuting() is called after that, which of course is too late in this case.\nSo I tried to set the culture on begin request (global.asax):\nprotected void Application_BeginRequest()\n{\n    Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture = new CultureInfo(\"de\");\n}\n\nWell, that did the trick. But I really think this is an ugly solution. So...\nThe Question: Am I Right and Do I Have Any Other Options?\nIs it true, that server-side validation takes the messages from resource before a filter could set the culture? If not, what am I doing wrong? If yes, is there another, cleaner option for setting the culture than the global.asax \"hack\"?\nThank you in advance.\n\nA:\n\nThanks to Stephen Muecke's answer, who pushed me in the right direction, I realized there are more filter interfaces which I could implement. A great overview of the MVC lifecycle can be found in this article. It points out that IAuthenticationFilter and IAuthorizationFilter implementations are invoked before the model binding happens.\nI decided to use these interfaces (IAuthorizationFilter in my case because IAuthenticationFilter is not available in MVC 3) for my CultureFilter:\n// would use IAuthenticationFilter in MVC 5\npublic class CultureFilter : IAuthorizationFilter\n{\n    public void OnAuthorization(AuthorizationContext filterContext)\n    {\n        // simplified for this example\n        Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture = CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo(\"de\");\n    }\n}\n\nThis might not be best practice, but in my opinion it's cleaner than using Application_BeginRequest in global.asax and I think, especially with IAuthenticationFilter, setting culture there is the better place than on model binding.\n\n", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "StackExchange"}}

{"text": "Potassium channels in the renal cortical collecting tubule (CCT) play an important role in potassium (K) secretion by the kidney and help to maintain the body's overall K balance. In this nephron segment, potassium secretion rates depend on both the apical membrane K permeability and the electrochemical driving forces for K across the apical membrane. The apical membrane K permeability relevant for K secretion appears to arise from a small conductance, mildly inward rectifying channel which has a high open probability (P-O) under normal conditions. However, the P-O of this channel is strongly dependent on intracellular pH. This largely explains the clinical observation that alkalosis is often associated with substantial K loss and hypokalemia. Recently two closely related renal K channels have been cloned from rat, designated ROMK1 and ROMK2. The physiological relevance of the ROMK family is its functional similarity to the small conductance apical K channels that are responsible for K secretion from mammalian CCT and K recycling in TALH. The predicted primary sequences and membrane topologies of ROMK are quite different from the voltage-gated K channels of excitable cells. However, both of these ROMK clones share significant homologies with the inward rectifier (IRK) family of channels that maintain resting potential near EK and permit long depolarizing responses in excitable cells. The present proposal exploits the structural and functional similarity between ROMK and IRK families to address some important issues regarding structure-function relations in ROMK2. Site directed mutagenesis will be used to determine the regions and specific residues of ROMK2 that are important for: (1) mild inward rectification, (2) strong pH dependence, (3) permeation path and selectivity characteristics, (4) site and affinity of barium block. The proposal also addresses structural issues involving the proximity of specific residues in the amino and carboxy termini to the putative pore region of the channel and to known \"inward rectifier\" sites in the second transmembrane spanning region. Interactions between K and barium within the conduction pathway will also be investigated as a method for characterizing the structure of the permeation path. The project will enhance our knowledge of basic processes underlying K homeostasis in health and disease.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "NIH ExPorter"}}

According to Variety, Universal has gained the rights to Daniel Silva\u2019s bestselling series of spy novels featuring recurring character Gabriel Allon, the latest of which was just released on July 24, 2007\u2014\u201cThe Secret Servant\u201d. Variety also reports that Guy Walks Into A Bar has acquired the rights to the first-person shooter videogame \u201cPainkiller\u201d from DreamCatcher Interactive. Another videogame, id Software\u2019s (Doom, Quake) Return To Castle Wolfenstein, has been secured by producer Samuel Hadida (Silent Hill, the Resident Evil franchise) with Roger Avary (Beowulf, Silent Hill) writing & directing. And Virgin Comics in cooperation with New Regency (The Fountain, Mr. & Mrs. Smith) is turning the comic book Virulents into a movie with John Moore (The Omen, Behind Enemy Lines) directing. Finally, just how desperate is Hollywood for material? First, I hear that Ridley Scott (Alien, Blade Runner, Gladiator) is involved in a movie based on the popular board game Monopoly, and then Disney recently purchased the rights to \u201cThe Dangerous Book For Boys\u201d, basically a nostalgic compendium \u201ccovering essential boyhood skills such as building tree houses, learning how to fish, finding true north, and even answering the age old question of what the big deal with girls is\u2026\u201d Doesn\u2019t exactly sound like blockbuster fare, but then again I didn\u2019t think Disney could make a successful movie based on a theme park ride (Pirates of the Caribbean) and look how that turned out :)In other news, Universal is remaking the Japanese ninja film \u201cShinobi\u201d (2005), which is based on the book, \u201cThe Kouga Ninja Scrolls\u201d (1959) by Futaro Yamada. There\u2019s actually an anime based on the novel as well called \u201cBasilisk\u201d, which I\u2019ve seen and is pretty interesting. The remake is supposed to be a modernization of the story according to Variety. Also being remade is the film Death Race 3000 (1975) that starred Sylvester Stallone (Rambo, Rocky) & David Carradine (Kill Bill, Kung Fu), with the updated version to be directed by Paul W.S. Anderson (Mortal Kombat, Resident Evil, AvP) and starring Tyrese Gibson (Transformers, Waist Deep).Finally, IGN has a couple of exclusive movie trailers to check out: The Nines starring Ryan Reynolds (Smokin\u2019 Aces, Van Wilder) & Hope Davis (The Matodor, The Weather Man) HERE, and GabrielHERE, which is about warring angels and looks like a cross between Underworld & The Matrix.\n\nHey, thanks! I might have to wait on that hamburger though.

{"text": "1. Field of the Invention\nThe present invention relates to a method for fabricating a FinFET transistor device, and more particularly to a method of fabricating a double gate MOSFET with a capability of inhibiting the depletion effect of the conductive gate while operating this device, which can hence elevate the device drive-on currents.\n2. Description of the Prior Art\nIn the past several years, significant progress has been made for the scaling of classical planar MOSFET (metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor) structure to the gate lengths below 65 nm. Despite difficulties in fabrication, sub-20 nm physical gate length MOSFETs have recently been demonstrated. However, further scaling of the planar structure below 50 nm becomes increasingly challenging due to excess leakage, degradation in mobility, and a variety of difficulties within the device processing. Therefore, alternative MOSFET structures and new process technologies need to be explored. The effective control of leakage in nano-scale transistors will be extremely important for high-performance densely packed chips such as microprocessors.\nThe double gate MOSFET, featuring excellent short-channel behavior and relaxed requirements for aggressive scaling of gate dielectrics and junction depths, is attractive for high-performance low power applications. Fully-depleted vertical double gate devices with symmetric gate structures feature a low vertical electrical field in the channel which is favorable to carrier transport. The FinFET is a promising vertical double gate structure, which has been demonstrated in the last few years at gate lengths ranging from 100 nm to 10 nm. Unlike other reported vertical double gate structures, the FinFET can be fabricated with minimal deviation from the industry standard CMOS process.\nThe FinFET transistors were fabricated on SOT (silicon-on-insulator) wafers with a modified planar CMOS process. FIG. 1A to FIG. 1F is an illustration of the general process flow for fabricating the FinFET transistor. At first, referring to FIG. 1A, a substrate such as a silicon on insulator (SOI) structure is provided, including a silicon substrate 10, a buried oxide layer (BOX) 11 and a silicon layer 12 on the buried oxide layer 11. A cap oxide layer 13 was thermally grown on the silicon layer 12 to relieve the stress between the ensuing nitride hard mask and the silicon layer 12. A silicon nitride layer 14 was deposited on the cap oxide layer 13, to serve as a hard mask.\nAfter the hard mask deposition, a photoresistor 15 is applied to define the hard mask through use of optical lithography, electron beam lithography, X-ray lithography, or other conventional means to produce a chemical etchant mask. Then, referring to FIG. 1B, after the mask definition, an etch process is used to pattern the hard mask and the device fin structure including a silicon drain region (not shown) and a silicon source region (not shown) connected by a silicon fin or channel 12, and thereafter the photoresistor 15 is removed. Referring to FIG. 1C, a thin sacrificial oxidation process maybe used to form a sacrificial oxide 16 on the two parallelly opposing sidewalls of the silicon fin 12 to repair any damage done to the fin surface during the etch process. Oxidation may also be used to reduce the fin width, thereby allowing sub-lithography dimensions to be achieved. The threshold (Vt) implants of NMOS and PMOS can be subsequently proceeded. Referring to FIG. 1D, the hard mask of the silicon nitride layer 14 and the thin sacrificial oxide 16 are removed to retain the cap oxide layer 13 on the silicon fin 12. Referring to FIG. 1E, a gate oxide 17 is grown or deposited on the two opposing sidewalls of the silicon fin 12. Then, referring to FIG. 1F, a polysilicon gate material is deposited over the surface of the silicon fin 12, a gate mask is defined on the polysilicon gate material and then the underlying gate material is etched to form a polysilicon gate 18 with the etching stopping on the cap oxide 13 and the buried oxide layer 11. An ion implantation process is performed to implant dopants in the polysilicon gate 18 for a desired threshold voltage Vth. Referring to FIG. 2, the source/drain regions 12A and 12B are also doped to make them electrically conductive electrodes in the subsequent source/drain ion implantations. Referring to FIG. 1F again, however, the distribution of the dopants in the polysilicon gate 18 is a gaussian distribution along the depth of the polysilicon gate 18. The portions of the polysilicon gate 18 nearby the bottom corners contained between the gate oxide 17 and the buried oxide layer 11 would have been more lightly doped, and have a larger resistance. Furthermore, upon operating the FinFET transistor, a depletion of the polysilicon gate 18 easily occurs, which in turn thickens the equivalent oxide thickness (EOT) of the gate dielectric 17, resulting in the reduction of the drive current of the FinFET transistor.\nAccordingly, it is an intention to provide a method of fabricating a FinFET transistor device, which can alleviate the problem encountered in the conventional process for fabricating the FinFET transistor.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "USPTO Backgrounds"}}
{"text": "Iverson paid for funeral, but can't stop its cause\n\nAllen Iverson this week did something that a bunch of people were quick to label as good, a few to dismiss as self-serving and the rest of us, I think, to receive as basically the only thing Iverson could think to do, which makes him fairly human in the face of a tragedy that transcends stardom.\n\nIverson's act\n\nIverson will pay for the funeral of a man who died three years after he was shot in southwest Philadelphia because he refused to hand over his Iverson jersey to a group of teens. Story.\n\nWhen Iverson offered to pay for the funeral of Philadelphian Kevin Johnson, he set into motion several conversations at once. The root was the circumstance of Johnson's death itself: It came from complications more than three years after Johnson, then 19, was shot and left paralyzed because he refused to surrender his Iverson replica jersey to a group of teenagers at a Philly trolley stop.\n\nIverson was, and remained, Johnson's favorite player. Johnson, who lived as a quadriplegic with his mother until his death Tuesday, will be buried with an Iverson jersey. Technically, his ventilator failed late last week, leaving Johnson in a vegetative state; but more broadly, his life changed forever because somebody was willing to shoot him over a uniform.\n\nAnd Iverson himself can do absolutely nothing about any of that, no more than he can prevent the next crime that's related to a material thing with some connection to sports. He couldn't prevent Johnson's shooting any more than Michael Jordan could prevent the 2005 death of Steven Terrett, who died on Chicago's South Side after apparently being shot by robbers who wanted his brand new Air Jordans.\n\nSo Iverson did the only thing he could think of, which was to call Johnson's grieving mother and ask if he could cover the cost of the funeral. Of course he can, and of course it is a decent and grounded gesture, even if it represents the slipperiest of slopes.\n\nI have no trouble believing Iverson was hit hard by the news. Despite his own history with weapons (Iverson once pulled a gun on a cousin while trying to locate his wife, with whom he was feuding), the Sixers' star sounded genuinely anguished Wednesday while discussing Johnson's fate.\n\nIverson recited gun-death statistics, including \"almost 400 people in Philadelphia\" this year (actually 357 as of this week). \"It's just terrible, what's going on in Philadelphia,\" he told reporters in Seattle before the Sixers played the Sonics. \"I just feel like I've got to do something more than I have been doing to try to help this situation as much as I can.\"\n\nAnd that's the rub, of course. The thing about being famous, or infamous, and monied is that it sometimes fosters the notion of a power that does not actually exist -- the power to transform society. As much as Iverson's words ring real, at the end of the day he is still a paid entertainer, not a social engineer. He won't solve gun crime in the inner city with a thousand free jerseys, or a million of them. But he will suffer all the same when something goes wrong that is even tangentially in his name.\n\nCharles Barkley first elicited some awe, and then guffaws, when he once upon a time told viewers of a Nike commercial, \"I am not a role model.\" Even Barkley now realizes that athletes in America are role models by definition, not choice. But his words have always been the source of great debate, just by the sheer audacity of what he (or the Nike scriptwriter) had to say.\n\nI'm now convinced that Barkley uttered those words with such sincerity and passion because, deep down, one of his great fears was that somebody would use him as a role model, and what kind of deal was that? He was young, rich, on the prowl. Where was the upside to someone using him as a model for anything other than life in the NBA?\n\nThere is a component to their lives that famous people, famous athletes, can never fully control, and that is what direction the public or the fans will take when it comes to them. For his part, Iverson's public past is a checkered one -- gun charges, marijuana charges -- and even though it may be deep past, the record of a star never really goes away. It had to strike the 31-year-old point guard that he is now officially part of the concerned sect of society, the people who want the violence to end sooner rather than later. He sounds an awful lot like a grown-up.\n\n\"It was tough to see somebody die for something senseless like that, over a jersey, over something material,\" Iverson said. \"Life is way more precious than a jersey.\"\n\nIf Iverson is looking for a way to channel his need to do something about the situation in Philadelphia, he can always follow Kevin Johnson's lead. Johnson spent the last three years of his life visiting schools and youth groups to warn kids and adults alike about the consequences of gun use. He was the living and suffering example of how badly it can go, and there are two other young men in prison as a result of their roles in that 2003 incident.\n\nOf course, Iverson can't change the situation by himself. Neither could Michael Jordan, and neither can anyone. But Iverson can do what he can do, and judging by his words this week, it is what he wants. Take him at those words, and keep watching.\n\nMark Kreidler's book \"Four Days to Glory: Wrestling With the Soul of the American Heartland,\" will be published by HarperCollins on Jan. 23, 2007, and may be preordered on amazon.com.

{"text": "Functional components of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signal transduction in pituitary cells. Identification of FGF response elements in the prolactin gene.\nFibroblast growth factors (FGFs) have been implicated in pituitary lactotroph tumorigenesis; however, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of FGF signal transduction. We used a transient transfection approach, in GH4 cells, to identify components of the FGF signaling pathway leading to activation of the rat prolactin (rPRL) promoter. Using dominant-negative constructs of p21(Ras), Raf-1 kinase, and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, we show that FGF activation of the rPRL promoter is independent of Ras and Raf-1 but requires MAP kinase. Furthermore, MAP kinase but not Raf-1 kinase catalytic activity is stimulated by FGFs. The rPRL promoter FGF response maps to two Ets binding sites, centered at -212 (FRE1) and -96 (FRE2), and co-transfection of dominant-negative Ets inhibits FGF activation. FRE1 co-localizes with a composite, Ets/GHF-1, Ras response element. However, overexpression of Ets-1 and GHF-1, which potentiate the Ras response, inhibits FGF stimulation of the rPRL promoter, implying that Ras and FGF signaling pathways target distinct factors to elicit their effects. These data suggest that Ets factors serve to sort and integrate MAP kinase-dependent growth factor signals, allowing highly specific transcriptional responses to be mediated via the interaction of distinct Ets proteins and cofactors at common response elements.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "PubMed Abstracts"}}

It is a challenging problem to try to understand the mechanisms which lead to this phenomenon\u00a0[@Smith].\n\nEigen has pointed out that each \u201cspecies\u201d actually consists of a more or less narrow distribution in the phase space of all possible genetic states, and this distribution may shift, in response to environmental pressure\u00a0[@Eigen]. Natural selection in response to environmental factors is usually modelled in terms of a \u201cfitness function\u201d which is a measure of the survival probability and/or reproductive capability of the individual.\n\nThose mutations which have a salutary effect on the fitness persist in the population and lead to new variants; other, neutral mutations may simply be carried along since they do not affect the well being of the individual. Deleterious mutations usually affect the organism adversely, and the accumulation of too many will reduce the fitness drastically.\n\nThe simplest hypothesis biologists have adopted regarding how the number of mutations affect the fitness, is that each deleterious mutation reduces the fitness by an identical factor, say $1/a$, $a > 1$. This is equivalent to assuming that the effect of each deleterious mutation is independent of the others, or that there is no \u201cepistasis\u201d between the mutations, and leads to a fitness function which decays exponentially with $m$, the number of mutations, as $f \\sim \\exp(-\\alpha m)$, where $\\alpha =\n\\ln a$.\u00a0[@Kondrashov1] A different type of assumption can be made, to take $f$ to depend on $m$ in a step-wise fashion, so that the value of $f$ is unaffected for $m$ less than a threshold, after which it is reduced drastically.\u00a0[@Jan]\n\nIt is clear, however, that there can be epistatic interactions between mutations at different points on the genetic string and that the expression of unmutated genes may be affected by the presence of mutations at certain loci, and so on.\u00a0[@Book] Therefore $f$ may depend not only on the total number of mutations, but also on their location, and may also increase as the result of mutations at certain loci. It has recently been pointed out that the fitness may depend strongly on the order in which certain mutations may occur\u00a0[@Kondrashov]. As a case in point, for a mutation leading to a certain modification to be beneficial, one must already have had a mutation leading to the emergence of a feature which will benefit from this modification.\n\nThis type of epistasis actually lends itself to a treatment in terms of statistical equilibria, with the appropriate choice of a fitness function.\u00a0[@Seher]\n\nIn this paper we will represent a complete genomic sequence with epistatic interactions by a one dimensional feromagnetic Ising model. We will subdivide the total genotype into subsequences (here taken to be of length 2, without any loss of generality), and stipulate that mutations can lead to salutory effects only if they occur in a certain order within these subsequences. We will further introduce a new quantity, the \u201ctolerance\u201d of the environment, which will have to be taken into acount to determine how strongly epistatis interactions affect the overall fitness. Our aim will be to compute, within this model, the effective correlations between mutations at different sites, at fixed tolerance, within a population at equilibrium.\n\nThe Model\n=========\n\nSince Eigen first introduced the quasi-species model\u00a0[@Eigen] bitstring models of genetic evolution have been extensively studied numerically\u00a0[@Oliveira; @Orcal; @Tuzel1; @Tuzel2]. In this approach, the genotype of an individual is represented by a string of Boolean variables $\\sigma_i$, $i=1,\\ldots N$, which can obviously be identified with a one dimensional system of Ising spins\u00a0[@McCoy]. If one takes the wild type, or the initial genotype, to consist of a string of 0\u2019s, each point mutation is indicated by flipping the bit representing a given gene, from 0 to 1.\n\nWe would like to avail ourselves of the analytically known results on the exactly solvable Ising model in equilibrium, to be able to make definite predictions regarding the correlation of mutated genes on a given genotype, under assumptions similar to those of Kondrashov and Kondrashov\u00a0[@Kondrashov].\n\nWe devide the one dimensional string of spins representing the state of the genome, into dimers. We demand that the fitness is only increased relative to the wild type (all zeroes) if the bits that flip to 1 occur sequentially. [@Kondrashov]. Thus, within each dimer, $(0,0)$, $(1,0)$, $(1,1)$ are in increasing order of fitness while $(0,1)$ is less fit than $(0,0)$.\n\nLet us first construct a cost function by defining the Ising Hamiltonian, = -J/2 \\_i s\\_i s\\_[i+1]{} - K\\_[i [odd]{}]{} s\\_i - H \\_[i [even]{}]{}s\\_i , \\[Ising\\] where for greater convenince in manipulation, we have defined the variables $s_i= 2(\\sigma_i - 1/2)$. The value of ${\\cal H}$ for each given sequence of $\\{s_i\\}$ will serve as a cost function, in terms of which we may define the fitness. Notice that in the first term, we have a coupling between nearest neighbors, which tends to reduce the \u201ccost\u201d for those configurations in which the adjacent \u201cspins\u201dare in the same state. If the constants, $K$ and $H$, which correspond to a staggered external field in an Ising model, are here chosen as $K=3J/4$ and $H=-J/4$, then we obtain a situation in which the dimer configurations $(-1,1)$, $(-1,-1)$, $(1,-1$ and $(1,1)$ have decreasing cost.\n\nThen $f$ is defined as $$f = {1 \\over Z}  e^{-\\beta H} \\label{Boltz}$$\n\nwhere $\\beta$ is a measure of how effective the cost function is in affecting the fitness, and $Z$ is a normalization factor so that $f \\in\n(0,1)$. Note that $f[\\{s_i\\}]$ can be identified as the Boltzmann factor in an equilibrium statistical model with the Hamiltonian $H$, at constant inverse \u201ctemperature\" $\\beta^{-1}$, and corresponds to the probablity of observing, within an equilibrium population, the particular genotype $\\{s_i\\}$. Temperature may be seen as the amount of randomness, or disorder in the system, competing with the cost function in determining the fitness. The higher the temperature, or randomness, the weaker will be the effect of the cost function in determining the state of the system. Therefore we define T\\^[-1]{}as the [*tolerance*]{} in the system. Here $J$ is a measure of the strength of the interaction between the states of each of the sites (alleles), $\\sigma_i$. Clearly, $\\beta$ and $J$ will always occur together in this model, in the product $\\beta J$, and we may simply absorb $J$ into the definition of $\\beta$.\n\nThe fitness $f$ is normalized to take values between $(0,1)$, by defining $$Z\\equiv \\sum_{\\{s_i\\}} e^{-\\beta H[\\{s_i\\}]}\\;\\;\\;.$$ Using the transfer matrix method, this sum may be computed exactly. We may then compute the expectation values $m_i=\\langle s_i\\rangle$. Note that the quantity $(m_i+1)/2$ corresponds to the probability of finding a mutation on either of the sublattices, $i$ odd, or $i$ even. The results are shown in Fig. 1, as a function of $T/J$, which is the (inverse) ration of the strength of the epistasis to the tolerance in the system. The \u201cstaggered magnetization,\u201d $m_s \\equiv \\langle s_{i\\, {\\rm\n(odd)}} - s_{i\\,{\\rm (even)}} \\rangle$ is shown in Fig. 2, and is twice the difference between the probabilities of encountering a mutation on either of the two sublattices (the first or the second sites beloging to a dimer). It is seen to peak sharply at small values of the tolerance, and then the difference decays to zero, as the tolerance becomes very large, at which point the fitness function becomes essentially flat.\n\nIn Fig. 3a, b and c, we display the correlation functions, $C_2 = \\langle\ns_i s_{i+2}\\rangle$ and $C_1=\\langle s_i s_{i+1}\\rangle$, as well as the subtracted correlation function $C_s \\langle s_i s_{i+2}\\rangle - \\langle\ns_i\\rangle \\langle s_{i+2}\\rangle$, as a function of $T/J$. It can clearly be seen here as well, that the effect of epistatic interactions in building up correlations between mutated sites on the gene string, is felt strongly within a given range of tolerances, in units of the strength of interaction. At $T=0$, since the genes are in the ordered state with all $s_i=1$, the excess correlation $C_s$ due to the interactions, is nil. In the other extreme of very large tolerances, the system is completely disordered, correlations vanish, so that the two terms in $C_s$ tend to each other, and both tend to zero.\n\nTo further elucidate the meaning of tolerance, we may compute the relative variances $v_m$, where\n\nv\\^2\\_m (s\\_i - m\\_i)\\^2. It is easy to see, that within a mean field approximation, where all the spins interact pairwise with each other, i.e., ${\\cal H} = -J/N \\sum_{(ij)}s_is_j$, $v_m^2 = T/2J$; thus the ratio $T/J$ is a measure of the size of the fluctuations about the mean. In genome space, this means $\\sqrt{T/J}$ is a measure of the radius of the distribution of genotypes about the most frequently encountred one, in equilibrium.\n\nconclusions\n===========\n\nIn summary, we have cast an epistatic quasispecies model interms of a one dimensional Ising model with staggered magnetic field, to give greater advantage to certain subsequences of genes that may be mutated. We defined a \u201ctolerance\u201d of the system, to introduce an equilibrium statistical ensemble, namely one whose statistical properties do not change in time. Correlations induced on the genetic sequence of individuals in this equlibrium population have been computed as a function of the tolerance and the strength of the epistatic interaction, using exact solutions of the Ising model in one dimension. It has been shown that non-trivial correlations between mutated sites on the gene string may arise only in a finite range of the tolerance for a given interaction strength.\n\n[**Acknowledgements**]{}\n\nWe are grateful to Seher \u00d6z\u00e7elik for many intersting discussions.

{"text": "Pages\n\nSunday, February 1, 2015\n\nBlack Alternate History Month\n\nThis year, I am going to be scheduling posts a little differently. I have experimented with theme months before to varying degrees of success, but have never been serious about keeping it going by coming up with new themes. My research into genre, however, has shown that alternate history is often dominated by \"great men\" who win (or lose) military battles, while being created mostly by white, American males.\n\nSo in 2015, I am going to try and highlight different perspectives on alternate history, spending more time on overlooked events and minority voices. Since February is Black History Month here in the United States, I thought this would be a perfect opportunity to cover Africa-American alternate history and creators.\n\nAlthough I give a lot of credit to Turtledove for introducing me to alternate history, one of the first non-Turtledove books I read was Lion's Blood by Steven Barnes. Called one of the most unusual alternate history novels ever published by Emily Stamm of io9, Lion's Blood showcased a world where civilization flourished in Africa and the Middle East, while Europe remained barbaric and primitive. In this timeline, black Africans have colonized what would have been North America, using white slaves sold to them by Viking raiders for the heavy labor.\n\nWhat made Lion's Blood significant was that it did not just create a mirror universe like the film White Man's Burden. Barnes set out to make this world as plausible as possible and while there are some parallels and squashed butterflies to be found, you still get a unique world that shows off Barnes' skill as world builder. In fact I still haven't read the sequel, Zulu Heart, for that very same reason. Its not that I did not enjoy Lion's Blood, its that I am afraid to sequel will ruin the original for me.\n\nOf course if you ask alternate historians (which I have) to recommend works of alternate history written by or based on African-Americans, most would recommend Terry Bisson's Fire on the Mountain. In this timeline, John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry touches off a massive slave rebellion that has wide reaching consequences for the entire world. Cory Doctorow called it \"one of the best alternate histories I've read\" and said it showed a different side to the usually absurd Bisson. Successful slave rebellion alternate histories like this aren't unheard of (see the \"The Lions are Asleep This Night\" by Howard Waldrop or, hell, the real world Haitian Revolution), but if we speak of blacks as slaves, then our minds usually turn to the American Civil War.\n\nYet African-Americans are usually either portrayed as having it worst off that our timeline (with good reason) or not mentioned at all in an American Civil War alternate history, especially in those featuring an independent Confederacy. In fact, I find later to be a worse portrayal as it confines an entire people's experience to the footnotes. This has often come up when reading web original alternate histories on the subject, but even mainstream publications are not exempt from this omission. Perhaps someone will write about this odd phenomenon in the future...\n\nSo for the month of February I am going to try and shine a light on African-American alternate history by not only posting articles on the subject or talking with African-American creators, but also highlighting news I come across on the Weekly Update and any other news posts I write in the coming weeks. If you would like to participate in some way, whether as a guest poster or an interviewee, contact me at ahwupdate at gmail dot com. Thanks and I hope you guys enjoy our exploration of this corner of our favorite genre.\n\n* * *\n\nMatt Mitrovich is the founder and editor of Alternate History Weekly Update and a blogger on Amazing Stories.

I could bind the PC to the domain and run the service as a domain user but what if I was using Linux?\n\nA:\n\nOn Windows, you cannot put credentials in UNC paths. You must provide them using net use, runas /netonly, or when asked by Windows. (If you have some programming skills, you can store the SMB password as a \"domain credential\" using CredWrite(), which is equivalent to checking the \"Remember password\" box in Windows.)\nOn Linux, it depends on the program.\n\nGNOME's Gvfs accepts the user@host syntax, but appears to completely ignore the password. (However, you can store it in GNOME Keyring beforehand.)\nsmbclient uses the same UNC syntax as Windows; however, it has an --authentication-file option from which credentials could be read.\nBoth programs above are using libsmbclient, and can use Kerberos authentication instead of passwords: run kinit user@YOUR.DOMAIN and use smbclient -k //host/share. This is more secure than password authentication.\n\nNote that putting passwords into URIs is deprecated, and you should not rely on it being supported anywhere.\n\nA:\n\nYou can map a \"drive\" to the UNC path using net use.

You can easily build your own notification template and add any number of attributes and features to a HermesNotification.\n\nHermes shows all queued up notifications at once, with an easy way to swipe through them (and will animate through them automatically if you don't touch any notifications for 3 seconds)\n\n##Installation\n###Cocoapods Installation\nHermes is available on CocoaPods. Just add the following to your project Podfile:\n\n```\npod 'Hermes', '~> 1.0'\n```\n\n###Non-Cocoapods Installation\nYou can drop Hermes' files directly into your project, or drag the Hermes project into your workspace.\n\n###Usage\nImport in **Swift**\n```swift\nimport Hermes\n```\nor **Objective-C**\n```objective-c\n#import <Hermes/Hermes.h>\n```\n\n##Getting Started\n###Components\n- **Hermes** (public)\n\n  You will use Hermes.sharedInstance to post Notifications.  You can tell Hermes when to *wait()* and collect notifications and when to *go()* and post notifications as soon as Hermes has any.\n  \n- **Notification** (public, extendable)\n\n  A Notification is a model that has attributes like text, image, sound, and color. You can extend or subclass Notifications and use them in custom NotificationViews\n  \n- **NotificationView** (public, extendable)\n\n  A NotificationView is a UIView that displays Notifications.  Hermes lets you subclass and display your own NotificationViews that match your app's style.\n  \n- **BulletinView** (protected)\n\n  The BulletinView is a UIView that shows 1 or many NotificationViews. Hermes does not let you subclass and use your own BulletinView.\n\n###How to use \n*In two easy steps!*\n\n1. Make one or many Notifications\n2. ```hermes.postNotifications([...])```\n\n###Sample code\n\n**Creating Notifications**\n```swift\n// uses Hermes singleton\nlet hermes = Hermes.sharedInstance\n\n// 'Upload Complete!' success Notification\nlet successNotification = HermesNotification()\nsuccessNotification.text = \"Upload complete!\"\nsuccessNotification.image = UIImage(named: \"success_icon\")\nsuccessNotification.color = .greenColor()\n\n// Call self.foo() when the NotificationView for this Notification is tapped\nsuccessNotification.action = { notification in\n    self.foo() \n}\n\n// 'Upload failed :(' failure Notification\nlet failureNotification = HermesNotification()\nfailureNotification.text = \"Upload failed :(\"\nfailureNotification.image = UIImage(named: \"error_icon\")\nfailureNotification.color = .redColor()\n```\n\n### Posting Notifications\n\n#####If you post Notifications while a Bulletin is already showing, it will show all of the new Notifications after the current Bulletin closes\n```swift\nhermes.postNotification(successNotification)\nhermes.postNotification(failureNotification)\n```\n\n#####You can tell Hermes to wait and go, to collect a bunch of notifications before showing them \n```swift\n// we could do use wait(), which tells Hermes to collect notifications without showing them yet\nhermes.wait()\n\n// post both the success and failure notification \nhermes.postNotification(successNotification)\nhermes.postNotification(failureNotification)\n\n// this tells Hermes to post all of the notifications in the queue\nhermes.go()\n```\n\n#####Or, you can post an array of notifications that Hermes will show immediately\n```swift\n// we could have also done the above code by simply using postNotifications\nhermes.postNotifications([successNotification, failureNotification])\n```\n\nIt's that easy!\n\n![hermes success notification](http://i.imgur.com/LnBCeAh.png)\n\n###Subclassing HermesNotificationView\nSubclassing HermesNotificationView is very easy, and gives you the freedom to make the view as simple or complicated as you want.\n```swift\nclass CustomNotificationView: HermesNotificationView {\n  override var notification: HermesNotification? {\n    didSet {\n      // update your view\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNext you need is to implement the HermesDelegate like this:\n```swift\nhermes.delegate = self\n```\n\nAnd the delegate method:\n```swift\nfunc hermesNotificationViewForNotification(#hermes: Hermes, notification: HermesNotification) -> HermesNotificationView? {\n        if notification.tag == kCustomNotificationTag {\n            return CustomNotificationView()\n        }\n        return nil\n    }\n```\nYou can tag HermesNotifications to help with determining which custom HermesNotificationView to use, or just always return your custom notification view.

{"text": "The amazingly unlikely true story of how a grumpy old man and lifelong bachelor won the love of a beautiful young woman and started a family \u2013 and all by writing a curmudgeonly blog about his lonely journey to the grave.\n\nNow who would have predicted that?\n\nWednesday, 19 March 2008\n\nThe wonders of true Northumberland (Tyne to Tweed)\n\n14st 2lb; zero alcohol; 1,416; Earthly Paradise?\n\nI wrote a column in the paper yesterday, much savaged by someone in the design department who found it less interesting than yet another bloody picture of Bamburgh Castle, which expressed my great enthusiasm for tasteless jokes, and my disappointment that the City specialists in this area had not yet come up with a real cracker about Bear Stearns. I have now spent the best part of 48 hours thinking of little else, and drawn a blank. I feel that there must be something to be made of the fact that my next-door neighbour would say \u201cBear Stearns\u201d if he were trying to convey the concept of bare stones. Rock, stones \u2026 is there a lesson here somewhere? Maybe it\u2019s just that you should never entrust your savings to any organization that sounds like it might once have boasted Fred Flintstone as a customer.\n\nToday I had lunch in Newcastle\u2019s substitute for The Ivy with one of my very few remaining clients and a couple of the region\u2019s top business journalists. My contribution was confined to filling any gaps in the conversation with Heather Mills jokes, and really, really enjoying my food. I had not realized how much my appreciation of flavours and textures would improve if I stopped stuffing myself all the time. I carefully chose what looked like the least fattening things on the menu, though for some reason they both came on a base of undercooked spuds, proudly billed as \u201cHeritage potatoes\u201d, presumably because the Heritage people had outbid the National Trust in some sort of sponsorship deal. Then I went mad and ordered the bitter chocolate mousse with blood orange granita, mainly because my provincial ignorance is so vast that I had no idea what a granita was (and partly to test their assurance that there were no Heritage potatoes at all involved in this course). Now I know exactly what a granita is, I\u2019m wondering whether that infamous former restaurant in Islington, where Blair legged over Brown, would have done half as well if they had called it by its English name: Slush Puppy.\n\nI drove back home in good time to take the dog for a walk up the hill from Biddlestone, past the isolated cottage of Singmoor. I had forgotten what a superb short walk this is, offering one of the best effort to reward ratios in the county. After a comparatively gentle climb, panoramic views open out in all directions, from the coast to the Simonsides and Cheviots.\n\nVue panoramique numero un: towards the coast\n\nVue panoramique numero deux: towards Simonside\n\nI heard the calls of skylarks and curlews, two of the most spirit-raising sounds I know. I stopped to lean on my stick in a rare moment of total contentment, and reflected how incredibly lucky I was to be able to combine this experience with lunch in a sophisticated metropolitan restaurant in a single day. Oops, I\u2019m beginning to sound like one of those \u201cPassionate People, Passionate Places\u201d adverts from the local tourist board. It\u2019s crap, really. Stay away.\n\nOn my descent, I passed a man reversing his van at high speed up the rocky track towards Singmoor. From the speed at which he was doing it, I deduced that he had a lot of practice in this art, and that it was his usual way of tackling the hill. It took me back to the ancient book called How To Drive A Car, which my father kindly lent me when I turned 17. That advocated tackling steep hills in reverse to increase traction, in the same helpful spirit that it recommended opening the windscreen to improve visibility in fog. It devoted an entire chapter to the art of double de-clutching. I was greatly disappointed when I got to my first driving lesson and found that this arcane knowledge was no longer required, but then I was also a bit flummoxed by the fact that the handbrake turned out to be on the inside of the car.\n\nNow I come to think of it, something very similar happened with The Joy Of Sex and what Viz refers to as the female \u201cgo\u201d button, but that\u2019s a story for another time and place.\n\nNo comments:\n\nAbout Me\n\nKeith Hann is a serial quitter: professionally as a historian (the last days of the British Empire), then an investment analyst (the last days of the British food industry) and finally as a financial public relations consultant (the last days of pretty much any company that was deluded enough to hire him). In each case he packed it in just when there might have been some chance of making a few quid out of it. Then there is his personal life score: engagements 4, marriages 1. For the last few years Keith has been indulging himself as a hobby journalist. It seems unlikely that he will ever make a living out of this. And if he ever shows signs of making it Big, his resignation will be going straight into the post. In November 2007 Keith started blogging (a) to take the mickey out of the genre, (b) because a misguided friend told him that it was the ideal way to secure his Big Break as a writer, and (c) to chronicle the final days of a dying breed of solitary English curmudgeon.

However, H. pylori is associated with the subtype of esophageal carcinoma, and long-term proton-pump inhibition usage would cause gastric atrophy in patients with persistent H. pylori infection, which is a precancerous lesion. The relationship between H. pylori infection and GERD is still unclear. We aimed to confirm whether the eradication of H. pylori would worsen or improve symptomatic or endoscopic GERD. A systematic review of the published data was undertaken, and a meta-analysis was performed to determine the effect of H. pylori eradication on the occurrence of symptomatic (heartburn, acid regurgitation) and endoscopically proven erosive (esophagitis) GERD in patients with or without pre-existing GERD. A total of 11 articles met the inclusion criteria and thus were included in the meta-analysis. There was no significant difference in the frequency of symptomatic or endoscopically proven erosive GERD after the eradication between patients with H. pylori eradicated and those with persistent infection, regardless of follow-up period, location, or the baseline disease. H. pylori eradication does not aggravate the clinical outcomes in terms of short-term and long-term posteradication occurrence of GERD.

{"text": "Of the handful of Democrats who opted to skip the party\u2019s convention this week, no one\u2019s absence was more conspicuous than Senator Claire McCaskill\u2019s. The freshman Senator, who in 2008 threw her support behind Barack Obama even when the smart money was on Hillary Clinton, opted to campaign in Missouri, where the electorate is hostile to the Obama and deeply skeptical of her early affinity for him.\n\nSo while Cory Booker was delivering his Tuesday night philippic, McCaskill was at tiny Westminster College, looking weary as she affirmed her commitment to federally-backed student loans for the third time in two days. Last night, after two mighty brief appearances at convention watch parties in St. Louis, McCaskill viewed Obama\u2019s speech in private, at her mom\u2019s house.\n\nBut while McCaskill was obviously missing from Charlotte, her opponent, Rep. Todd Akin, was even more ghostlike in the very state he hopes to capture from her.\n\nSince proclaiming, on August 19, that the female body has natural contraceptive powers in instances of \u201clegitimate rape,\u201d Akin has made but two public appearances: One awkwardly short press conference to reaffirm his Senate candidacy, and a parade appearance last Thursday in Bethany\u2014a dusty collection of storefronts along the two-lane highway connecting Kansas City and Des Moines.\n\nAt first, the Bethany appearance seemed a sign that Akin\u2019s campaign was back underway. But he hasn\u2019t resurfaced since. He has been with Missouri mostly in spirit, his legend invoked by detractors but his person elusive. His remark that student loans are \u201ca stage-three cancer of socialism,\u201d for instance, is ever-present in McCaskill\u2019s stump speech. Sandra Fluke uttered his name in a televised interview following her primetime convention appearance. Yesterday, the nuns of the Nuns on the Bus staged a protest at his Ballwin, Missouri office\u2014but he didn\u2019t seem to be there.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}
{"text": "Will there ever be peace for Myanmar\u2019s stateless Rohingya minority?\n\nCompounded by years of international pressure and criticism, it appears that the embattled Burmese state is now opening up to the possibility of mediation with regard to the 2017 Rohingya crisis. Only two years ago, hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees fled from Myanmar\u2019s Rakhine State as Burmese military cracked down on hapless Rohingya communities, citing terrorist activities and the need to defend sovereign soil.\n\nWith firebrands like Wirathu still spreading hate speech against Muslims, both Bangladesh and Myanmar face a continuing crisis that can no longer be addressed by simply refusing to acknowledge the problem in the first place.\n\nASEAN\u2019s role\n\nRecently an ASEAN-ERAT team was deployed to Myanmar to assess the current conditions at the Rakhine State, to pave the way for the eventual repatriation of the stateless Rohingya. However, the current clashes between the insurgent Arakan Army and Myanmar security forces have frozen repatriation efforts, and have made it doubly harder to accomplish a lot on the ground.\n\nIt is becoming a fortunate reality in Myanmar that an increasingly large portion of the public is acknowledging that something has to be done about the problem now, and the previous non-interference stance of the surrounding ASEAN community is no longer helping the crisis.\n\nRakhine and Kachin states under siege\n\nDiplomatic measures, as well as a closer look on the more practical, domestic dimensions of the crisis are seen as areas where the ASEAN can help Myanmar. According to a combined statement by INGOs operating in Myanmar, including Action Contre La Faim and Relief International, up 95,000 people in the Rakhine State have been cut off from essential and basic services due to the on-going clashes between the Arakan Army and Myanmar\u2019s military.\n\nThe northern Kachin State is also suffering from increased military operations, and the government has set negotiations with insurgents on April 30.\n\nAccording to the Kachin Independence Organization, all the residents want now is peace, and to be able to return to their homes. On the Bangladeshi side, the government\u2019s initial plan to relocate more than 100,000 Rohingyas to the island of Bhasan Char has fallen apart, as international groups insisted that the relocation should be completely voluntary on the part of the Rohingyas. Bangladesh is host to around 1.2 million Rohingyas, and now faces an uncertain political future because of the Myanmar exodus.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "The present invention relates to a method for wave soldering printed circuit boards wherein a solder coating is applied only where needed.\nA usual automatic wave soldering apparatus includes a pair of endless chain conveyors driven to advance a printed circuit board at a constant speed from the entrance to exit ends of the apparatus. With the printed circuit board held by gripping fingers, the board is first carried to a fluxer where a foam or spray of flux is applied to the underside of the board. The printed circuit board is then carried over preheaters where the temperature of each board is elevated to approximately 110\u00b0 C. to 130\u00b0 C. so as to evaporate excess flux solvent, activate the flux and minimize thermal shock to the printed circuit board. After the printed circuit board is brought to such a preheat temperature, the board is passed over a solder reservoir to receive solder. The board is finally transported to a cool down zone where the solder is cooled to solidify.\nTypically, pin grid alley modules and dual in-line packages are loaded onto one side of a printed circuit board, with their terminals or leads projecting downwardly through apertures in the printed circuit board. To increase packaging density, a number of surface mounted devices and connectors are loaded onto the other, underside side of the printed circuit board. Problems have arisen from wave soldering such a printed circuit board. Too much heat occurs on the underside of the board, when contacted with a solder wave, and tends to damage the surface mounted devices.\nAttempts have been made to locally apply solder to preselected conductor areas on a printed circuit board, but not to those areas where surface mounted devices and connectors are mounted. In one known method, flux is locally spayed onto preselected conductor areas on a printed circuit board. The fluxed board is then preheated by a stream of warm gas to evaporate flux solvent. Thereafter, the board is positioned over a plurality of solder wave nozzles arranged within a solder reservoir. At this time, the solder wave nozzles are brought into alignment with a plurality of sets of preselected areas on the printed circuit board. A pump is arranged within the solder reservoir to force heated molten solder to flow upwardly through the solder wave nozzles so as to form solder waves. The preselected areas on the printed circuit board are contacted with the respective solder waves to make soldered joints. The height of the solder waves is then lowered until it becomes equal to the surface level of the molten solder within the solder reservoir. The position of the board is maintained until the solder solidifies. Finally, the board is delivered to a cool down zone wherein the printed circuit board is cooled.\nThis known method has proven to be effective for eliminating heat damage to sensitive electronic components such as surface mounted devices, but the method suffers from certain disadvantages. One problem is the attachment of solder oxides, better known as dross, and carbonized flux to soldered joints on a printed circuit board. Part of the molten solder tends to remain on the inner wall of the solder wave nozzles when the molten solder is immediately returned to the solder reservoir. The solder, typically composed of tin and lead, has a tendency to oxidize in the atmosphere. The resulting oxides are detrimental to the quality of the soldered joints. Also, part of the flux which has previously been applied to the soldered joints could be attached to the inner wall of the solder wave nozzles. This flux is carbonized by the heat from the molten solder. The resulting carbide could be attached to the inner wall of the solder wave nozzles. The oxides and the carbide will be separated from the inner wall of the solder wave nozzles when the molten solder within the solder reservoir is pumped up through the solder wave nozzles to process a next printed circuit board. The oxides and the carbide could be attached to soldered joints formed on the next printed circuit board. Another problem is the formation of icicles, solder bridges and other imperfections in the solder. When the conductor areas on the board are not sufficiently preheated, the solder solidifies before the conductor areas are completely wetted. This results in faulty solder connections. Also, such imperfections occurs when the solder wave is detached from the printed circuit board too fast.\nAccordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a method for locally applying solder to preselected conductor or solderable areas on a printed circuit board, which prevents the occurrence of icicles, bridges and other solder imperfections, and which can force solder into through holes and other hard-to-reach areas to be soldered.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "USPTO Backgrounds"}}

Heard, Jr., San Antonio, Thomas Goggan, Roy E. Greenwood, Austin, for appellant.\nBill White, Criminal Dist. Atty., Elizabeth Taylor, Sam Ponder, Hipolito Canales, Jr., David Berchelmann, Jr., Jerry Rosson, Asst. Criminal Dist. Attys., San Antonio, for appellee.\nBefore CADENA, CANTU and DIAL, JJ.\n\nOPINION\nCANTU, Justice.\nAppellant was convicted, by a jury, of murder under TEX.PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 19.02(a)(2) (Vernon 1974).[1] Punishment was assessed by the trial court at imprisonment in the Texas Department of Corrections for a term of twenty-five years.\nThe sufficiency of the evidence is not challenged but a brief recitation of the facts is necessary to effectively address appellant's contentions.\nThe evidence reflects that on February 10, 1978, at approximately 6:15 p.m., medical technicians with the Emergency Medical Services of the City of San Antonio responded to a poisoning call at 502 Frio Street. As the EMS vehicle pulled up, a woman later identified as appellant, brought a child wrapped in a blanket out to the vehicle. The child was semi-conscious and bore numerous bruises on her arms, legs, back and buttocks.\nAppellant initially suggested to the EMS technicians that the child had swallowed \"Pine-Sol\" cleaning fluid and had fallen down some stairs.\nThe child died at the Bexar County Hospital after being treated by Dr. David Oberndorf. According to Dr. Oberndorf the child had suffered a ruptured spleen, a ruptured liver, a skull fracture and various other internal injuries. Cause of death was thought to be due to massive internal bleeding and shock.\nOn February 11, 1978, Homicide detective Abel Juarez spoke with appellant and, following a Miranda[2] warning, he obtained a statement from appellant.[3]\n*308 As a result of the statement, detective William Wolfe went to appellant's home and obtained a belt and a board that had been mentioned in appellant's statement.\nDr. Ruben Santos, the Bexar County Medical Examiner, confirmed the cause of death to be the result of internal bleeding and serious internal injuries.\nAppellant relied upon the defense of alibi and upon the declaration of a third party admitting guilt through the judicial confession of Andrew Lara, appellant's thirteen year old mentally retarded brother. Appellant did not testify.\nBy her first ground of error, appellant claims the trial court erred in denying her motion for mistrial urged during final arguments when the State prosecutor allegedly commented on her failure to testify.\nIt was the defense's theory that appellant's brother Andrew, a mental retardate who suffered seizures, had inflicted the injuries resulting in the child's death during one of these seizures at a time when appellant, her mother and grandmother were away from the home.\nThe State countered with the theory that, Andrew had been instructed by someone to take the blame for the homicide so as to exonerate appellant.\nDuring final jury arguments the prosecutor argued:\n(Prosecutor): Thank you. But, then, of course, the catch-all in this is, well, don't worry about Roland and Andrew's story not jiving, because poor Andrew probably just couldn't remember, this is a part of his disease. Well, you know, that's just really convenient. I mean, that just plugs in everything. When in doubt, well, he can't remember, so it's all right, skip over that, or perhaps he is not remembering it right. Well, that's ridiculous, too. Please don't brand Andrew as a murderer. This woman did it and she should be found guilty of it.\nAlso, remember the picture that was painted of Andrew by others. The one thing we do know, he did have a grand mal seizure. No one is contesting that. But he had it as a result of a drug given to him before surgery. Since that time, the only rage, only seizure we know about that they say they know about is the beating death of Valerie. Did you hear anyone else every talk about how he smashes things, how he becomes irritable, can't sleep? All you heard about was from the doctor. Did his family get up there and say that? No. They didn't. Did you hear about any other rages he has had, any other attacks on children? No. In fact, Ms. Callaway told you, well, we have got this little dwarf, eight year old girl that's about the size of a one year old, and what does Andrew do? He helps her, picks her up so she can drink water. And what did Andrew tell you about what happens when people pick on him? I go to another place to think. That's not a boy that could do what was done to Valerie. Not Andrew Lara.\nThe doctor also made a point of he had hoped a question would be asked while Andrew was rubbing his head and looking confused, because maybe he was having a petit mal seizure. Well, if that's indication of seizure, I think there are an awful lot of us that are in trouble. An awful lot of us, including myself. Because I often do that. But I would suggest to you when Andrew did that what he was doing was trying to remember what he had been told to say. And don't misunderstand me, I am not accusing Mr. Heard or Mr. Goggan of doing this, no. But he does have a family, and we haven't heard from all of the family. And\u0097\n\n*309 MR. HEARD: Your Honor, that's a comment on the failure of the defendant to testify and we move a mistrial. We object to it and we ask for a ruling on the objection.\nTHE COURT: All right. The jury will be instructed to disregard the last comment by the prosecutor with the regard to comment that she made about the family.\nMR. HEARD: Your Honor, for the reasons previously stated, we must now move for a mistrial.\nTHE COURT: Overruled. (Emphasis supplied.)\nAppellant argues that the comment, \"... we haven't heard from all the family\" necessarily amounts to a direct comment upon appellant's failure to testify under the facts and circumstances presented in the case.\nFrom the defense's evidence it was established that only three persons, besides the deceased, were at the scene of the homicide, thirteen year old Andrew Lara, his nine year old brother Roland Arriaga and appellant's four year old son. Since Andrew and Roland testified, appellant reasons only she remained as a potential witness because four year old Johnny was not a competent witness and thus the prosecutor's argument necessarily referred to her. We do not view the prosecutor's argument in the same light as does appellant nor do we think the jury naturally and necessarily took it to be a comment on appellant's failure to testify.\nIt is basic and fundamental constitutional and statutory law in this State that the failure of an accused to testify during his trial may not be the subject of direct or indirect comment by a prosecuting attorney during his final jury argument. See Angel v. State, 627 S.W.2d 424 (Tex.Cr.App.1982); TEX. CONST. art. I, \u00a7 10; TEX.CODE CRIM.PROC.ANN. art. 38.08 (Vernon 1979).\nA direct comment upon a defendant's failure to testify will result in a reversal unless the error is shown to be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\nFor an indirect comment to constitute reversible error, it must call for a denial of an assertion of fact by contradictory evidence that only the defendant is in a position to offer. Nickens v. State, 604 S.W.2d 101 (Tex.Cr.App.1980, En Banc).\nThe statute is not shown to have been infringed by disclosing that counsel, in argument, used language which might be construed as an implied or indirect allusion to the failure of the accused to testify. To come within the prohibition, the implication must be a necessary one, that is, one that cannot reasonably be applied to the failure of the accused to produce other testimony than his own. Where there is other evidence to the absence of other evidence, to which remarks may reasonably have been applied by the jury, the statute is not transgressed. Garrett v. State, 632 S.W.2d 350 (Tex.Cr.App.1982).\nThe test employed is whether the language used was manifestly intended or was of such character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the accused's failure to testify. Bird v. State, 527 S.W.2d 891 (Tex.Cr.App. 1975).\nIn applying this test, the facts and circumstances of each case must be analyzed to determine whether the language used was of such character. Nickens v. State, supra.\nThe reference by the prosecutor, to not having heard from all the family, contrary to appellant's contention, did not address potential witnesses to the assault. Rather, it is evident, the prosecutor was arguing that there were several family members who might have influenced Andrew to testify in a manner exonerating appellant. When considered in its entirety, the prosecutor's argument was not manifestly intended nor was it of such character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the accused's failure to testify.\n*310 There were two adult family members who the jury knew about that did not testify and who were in a position to exert influence upon Andrew. According to Andrew, his mother, his grandmother and appellant were all away from home at the time of the incident. Thus, while Andrew's mother and grandmother could not shed light on the assault, both or either might have shed light on Andrew's manner of testifying, and could have offered contradictory evidence to the effect that Andrew was not told to perjure himself.\nWe hold that the language complained of is not a direct comment nor does it necessarily refer to appellant's failure to testify by implication.\nWe further note that the cautious trial court immediately instructed the jury to disregard any reference to family members. Although we hold the argument to be proper, any possibility of error was cured by the trial court's instruction. Anderson v. State, 633 S.W.2d 851 (Tex.Cr. App.1982). Appellant's first ground of error is overruled.\nBy her second ground of error, appellant alleges that the trial court erred in overruling her objection to improper jury argument by the prosecutor. It is contended that the trial court's ruling constituted a comment on the weight of the evidence.\nDuring final jury arguments, the prosecutor stated:\nAnd please remember one of my last questions to Andrew was, Andrew, you really didn't hit her, did you, and in a very small voice he said `no.' Please remember that question and answer.\nCounsel for appellant immediately objected to the prosecutor's argument, with the following objection:\nYour Honor, we object to that. That's not the testimony. The jury should be instructed to go by what they remember.\nThe objection was overruled and no instruction was given. Appellant contends that the action by the trial court in overruling her objection and in refusing the instruction requested constituted a comment on the weight of the evidence amounting to error of constitutional dimension.\nTEX.CODE CRIM.PROC.ANN. art. 38.05 (Vernon 1979) provides:\nIn ruling upon the admissibility of evidence, the judge shall not discuss or comment upon the weight of the same or its bearing in the case, but shall simply decide whether or not it is admissible; nor shall he, at any stage of the proceeding previous to the return of the verdict, make any remark calculated to convey to the jury his opinion of the case.\nAppellant's contention that the trial court's ruling was, in effect, equivalent to informing the jury that it was the court's recollection that the prosecutor's version of the facts was correct is without merit.\nThe court's ruling in this case was nothing more than the court carrying out its duty to rule on objections without embellishment or unwarranted comment. Smith v. State, 595 S.W.2d 120 (Tex.Cr.App.1980), rev'd on other grounds sub nom. Ex parte Smith, 650 S.W.2d 68, 70 (Tex.Cr.App.1982) (en banc opinion after remand).\nThe record reflects the following testimony during the trial:\n(PROSECUTOR):\nQ: Andrew, you really didn't hit Valerie, did you?\nA: On the wall?\nQ: No, anytime?\nA: No.\nThe record supports the prosecutor's version of the facts. The trial court correctly ruled on the objection without invading the jury's province as fact finders and judges of the credibility of the witnesses and without giving credence to the State's version of a disputed fact issue. Appellant's second ground of error is overruled.\nAppellant, in her third ground of error, urges that the trial court erred in failing to sustain her timely objection to what she contends were inflammatory and prejudicial photographs.\n*311 The photographs complained about are of the deceased child taken by the treating physician and depict the bruised body of the child as seen at the hospital.[4] The two EMS technicians testified that the photographs accurately depicted the condition of the child at the time they responded to the Frio Street address. The photographs were admitted into evidence following verbal descriptions of the deceased's physical appearance.\nThe admissibility of a photograph is conditioned on its identification by a witness as an accurate portrayal of facts relevant to the issue and on verification by such witness or a person of knowledge that the photograph is a correct representation of such facts. Goss v. State, 549 S.W.2d 404 (Tex.Cr.App.1978).\nThough the photographs are gruesome, they are competent, material, relevant to the issues of identification of the deceased and the cause of death, and admissible the same as a verbal description of the body of the victim. Moreno v. State, 587 S.W.2d 405 (Tex.Cr.App.1979); Martin v. State, 475 S.W.2d 265 (Tex.Cr.App.1972), overruled on other grounds, Jackson v. State, 548 S.W.2d 685, 690 (Tex.Cr.App. 1977), dism'd w.o.j., 409 U.S. 1021, 93 S.Ct. 469, 34 L.Ed.2d 312 (1972). Appellant's third ground of error is overruled.\nIn her fifth ground of error, appellant complains of the trial court's ruling admitting her written confession into evidence. Appellant asks us to hold that her written confession was inadmissible, as a matter of law, because the medical testimony indicates that she suffered from diminished capacity and could not have voluntarily given a written confession.\nPrior to trial, a Jackson v. Denno[5] hearing on the voluntariness of the confession was conducted.\nDetective Juarez testified that he came in contact with appellant at the police station on February 11, 1978 at about 9:45 a.m. After he administered the Miranda warning to her, he ascertained that she understood the meaning of the warning. Juarez, while communicating with appellant in English and in Spanish, commenced to reduce her statement to writing. Detective Lloyd R. Brown then read the statement back to her slowly in English and appellant verified that the statement was true and correct. Appellant signed the statement in his presence and in the presence of two other lay witnesses.\nAppellant, testifying in her own behalf, admitted telling Detective Juarez that she had beaten her child. She further admitted signing the confession in his presence and in the presence of two other lay witnesses after it was read back to her by Detective Brown. She, however, denied that the statement was true.\nAppellant also called as her witness, Dr. Betty Lou Schroeder, a clinical psychologist, who testified she had performed several tests on appellant designed to measure her mental ability. According to Schroeder, appellant possessed a numerical IQ of 56 but was capable of understanding the meaning of a jury trial, and the right to maintain her silence. Schroeder believed appellant was capable of knowingly waiving these rights and further believed that appellant understood the meaning of the charges against her and could assist her attorney in the preparation and trial of her case. Schroeder concluded that, in her opinion, appellant was capable of giving a voluntary confession.\nAppellant's mother and brother, Andrew, testified and related aspects of appellant's prior medical history.\nAfter the testimony, the trial court found, beyond a reasonable doubt, the following:\n1) On February 10, 1978, at 6:55 P.M., Emergency Medical Service Personnel answered an emergency call at the home of Mary Jane Rodriguez. The Defendant *312 brought to the Emergency Medical Personnel a semi-conscious child, that appeared to be seriously beaten. That child, Valerie Rodriguez, the daughter of the Defendant died that day from internal injuries.\n2) On February 11, 1978, the Defendant was in custody of San Antonio Police at the County Jail.\n3) Appellant[6] speaks and understands the English language but does not read.\n4) At 9:45 P.M., on February 11, 1978, Detective Abel Juarez just came into contact with the Appellant at the Police Station and informed the Appellant of her rights by reading those rights from a San Antonio Police Department Warning Card as follows:\n... Before you are asked any questions, it is my duty as a Police Officer to advise you of your rights and to warn you of your rights and to warn you of the consequences of waiving those rights.\nNumber 1: You have the right to remain silent.\nNumber 2: You do not have to make any statement, oral or written, to anyone.\nNumber 3: Any statement you make will be used in evidence against you in a Court of Law at your trial.\nNumber 4: You have the right to have a lawyer present to advise you before and during any questioning by either police officers or attorneys representing the State.\nNumber 5: You may have your own lawyer present or if you are too poor to hire a lawyer, then the court will appoint a lawyer for you free of charge now or at any other time.\nNumber 6: If you decide to talk with anyone, you can or you can stop talking to them at anytime you want.\nNumber 7: The above rights are continuing rights which can be urged by you at any stage of the proceedings.\nWhen asked if she understood these rights, the appellant said she did and she willingly answered questions of Detective Juarez. Appellant never attempted to exercise any of the aforementioned rights.\n5) Just prior to the taking of the written statement, Detective Juarez again advised her of her rights as were contained on State's Exhibit No. 1.\n6) At the Police Station, the Appellant's statement was reduced to typewritten form and was signed by the Appellant. Prior to the Appellant signing the statement, Detective Lloyd R. Brown read the Appellant's statement back to her slowly from top to the bottom of the page.\nThe Appellant stated that she did understand the statement and that it was true and correct. Two (2) civilian employees of the San Antonio Police Department as well as Detective Juarez and Detective Brown witnessed Appellant's signature at 10:25 A.M.\n7) No force, threats, persuasion, or promises nor any form of coercion were used in obtaining Defendant's confession.\n8) While the Appellant has less than normal intelligence, she was knowledgeable of the situation and was mentally capable of knowingly and intentionally waiving her right to remain silent and to make a knowing and voluntary confession.\n9) There is evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the confession was freely and voluntarily given and with a complete understanding by the Appellant of her federal and state constitutional rights which had been read to her.\n\nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW\nThe court concludes as matters of law.\n1) The Defendant, after repeated warnings, knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived her rights under TEX.CODE CRIM.PROC.ANN. art. 38.22 (Vernon 1979).\n2) The Defendant's confession was not the product of force, threats, persuasion, *313 intimidation, or promises, but was freely and voluntarily given.\n3) The Defendant's voluntary confession was therefore admissible in evidence as a matter of law.\nThe record fully supports the findings of the trial court.\nAppellant's contention that the evidence showed that her mentality was such that she could not, as a matter of law, knowingly and intelligently waive her right to remain silent is not supported by the record.\nThe testimony of officer Juarez and others who came into contact with appellant at the time of the execution of the written confession as well as appellant's own testimony at the hearing belies her contention that she, as a matter of law, was of abnormal mentality which prevented her from understanding the meaning and effect of her confession. Cf. Grayson v. State, 40 Tex.Cr.R. 573, 51 S.W.2d 246 (1899).\nIn determining the admissibility of a confession of a crime, the fact that it was made by one whose mentality was at a lower than normal level is to be taken into consideration and viewed as a factor indicating, although not establishing, that the confession was lacking in voluntariness. Casias v. State, 452 S.W.2d 483 (Tex.Cr. App.1970); Hanus v. State, 104 Tex.Cr.R. 543, 286 S.W. 218 (1926).\nA confession is not inadmissible merely because the accused, who is not claimed to be insane, is of less than normal intelligence. See Vasquez v. State, 163 Tex.Crim. 16, 288 S.W.2d 100 (1956).\nAlthough the record verifies that appellant is of low mentality we cannot say that, as a matter of law, her low mentality is such as prevents her from knowingly and voluntarily giving and acknowledging her written confession. Appellant's fifth ground of error is overruled.\nThe fourth ground of error alleges that the trial court erred in excluding from evidence a tape recording of a conversation between appellant's expert witness and Andrew Lara.\nAppellant argues the admissibility of the taped conversation as an oral confession pursuant to the provisions of TEX.CODE CRIM.PROC.ANN. art. 38.22 (Vernon Supp.1982-83), as invited evidence and as impeachment evidence.\nAppellant called Dr. Larry Aniol, a clinical psychologist, as a defense witness. Dr. Aniol described the psychological makeup of Andrew Lara. During cross-examination by the State, the doctor was asked whether he believed or disbelieved Andrew's incriminating story. Dr. Aniol testified that Andrew's admission of guilt was consistent with the evidence, was reasonable and in his mind created a doubt that appellant committed the murder. During redirect, Dr. Aniol related that he had been in the courtroom throughout Andrew's entire testimony. He further testified, without objection, that the version of the events testified to by Andrew was consistent with the previous conversation he had with Andrew wherein guilt had been admitted by Andrew.\nDr. Aniol revealed that he had tape recorded his interview with Andrew. The tape was marked and offered as defense exhibit number 4 but was not received into evidence by the trial court. Appellant was then permitted to ask Dr. Aniol whether Andrew's testimony was consistent with the contents of the recording. Dr. Aniol replied in the affirmative and offered the opinion that Andrew was telling the truth both from the witness stand and during the interview.\nThe State offered, in rebuttal, the testimony of Detective Frank Castillon who submitted a prior written statement made by Andrew which was inconsistent with his testimony given at trial and which corroborated appellant's confession.\nAppellant then sought to reoffer the taped recording as a \"prior consistent statement\" seeking to rebut a prior inconsistent statement. This second tender was withdrawn by appellant prior to a court ruling and with the stated purpose of preserving error only as might have occurred *314 due to the trial court's denial of the initial tender.\nWe focus our attention, in reviewing appellant's alleged error, only upon the circumstances and facts comprising the initial tender and the corresponding court ruling.\nThe record reflects the following relative to the tender of the tapes:\n(DEFENSE ATTORNEY)\nMR. HEARD: We now offer in evidence the tape identified as Defendant's Exhibit No. 4.\n* * * * * *\nTHE COURT: I don't know what the purpose of the offer is.\nMR. HEARD: Ask for it to be received in evidence. That's the purpose of the offer, your Honor.\n* * * * * *\nMR. HEARD: We believe they have opened the door to it asking his opinion as to truthfulness and so on and so forth. We want to go into that and want to show what the children told him, want to show how it all developed.\nTHE COURT: Well, you have the opportunity of\u0097had the opportunity to ask him whether what they said then corresponded with what they say now, and I don't know whether you have covered it adequately to satisfy yourself. To go and play these tapes at this time without\u0097for the purpose that you enumerate, I am not\u0097\nMR. HEARD: Your Honor, we think they are relevant and we don't know of any possibility under which they could be excluded in evidence.\nTHE COURT: I don't know what part of them you claim are relevant. I don't know what the tapes say. I have no way of knowing. They are just tapes. I can't read them, I can't look at them.\nMR. HEARD: Well, we suggest that they be received in evidence and played to the court and jury. If they want to interpose an objection\u0097\nTHE COURT: That will be overruled.\nMR. HEARD: Okay. Then I will examine him concerning them, Your Honor.\n* * * * * *\nFollowing the trial court's ruling, appellant was permitted to inquire of the witness into those matters forming the basis for the prior tender of the taped recordings.\nAppellant, presumably, was satisfied with the scope of examination permitted. We note that the objectives sought to be achieved by appellant, as enumerated to the court during the tender, were met.\nSince the taped recordings were never offered into evidence on a bill of exception, this court is in no position to determine the nature of the evidence sought to be admitted. We are relegated to the purposes stated by defense counsel as sought to be achieved and we are convinced that those purposes were met through the testimony of Dr. Aniol.\nAppellant recognizes that, in Texas, declarations of a third party admitting guilt of a crime for which another is on trial are admissible only when the State is relying upon circumstantial evidence, when the guilt of such party is inconsistent with the guilt of the accused, and when the facts show that such third party was so situated that he might have committed the crime. Ramirez v. State, 543 S.W.2d 631 (Tex.Cr. App.1976).\nAppellant recognizes that the existence of the written confession poses a barrier and removes the case from the realm of circumstantial evidence but asks this court to engraft an exception because \"the State's case would have been wholly insufficient had the confession not been available.\" We disagree.\nAside from the confession of appellant, there is other evidence in the record supporting a finding that Andrew did not strike the child and that appellant committed the acts. Still, the confession is alone sufficient to prevent the rule in Ramirez from rendering admissible appellant's tender of proof.\nNor do we believe the recordings were admissible because the State opened the *315 door or invited the evidence. Appellant seems to be arguing that because the trial court offered her wide latitude in permitting her to prove up the desired testimony from Dr. Aniol in lieu of admitting the recordings that cross-examination of the witness by the State constituted a waiver of objection by the State as to the admissibility of the recordings.\nAppellant candidly suggests that since Dr. Aniol testified that he believed Andrew was telling the truth, she should be permitted to further demonstrate the basis for Dr. Aniol's ability to determine the credibility of his patient. We believe that appellant's stated intent was to bolster the testimony of Dr. Aniol and nothing more. Still, in the absence of a bill of exception, we are in no position to determine what effect, if any, the recordings may have had and, therefore, appellant has not demonstrated that the admission of the recordings would have achieved the result she now advocates. For the same reason, we are constrained to hold that appellant is precluded from contending that the recording constituted a prior consistent statement. But if it did, the testimony of Dr. Aniol developed in lieu of the recording certainly meets the declared desired result and we can perceive no harm to appellant by the trial court's exclusion of the recording. Appellant's fourth ground of error is overruled.\nWe find no error calling for reversal and the judgment of the trial court is, therefore, affirmed.\nNOTES\n[1]  \"A person commits an offense if he:\n\n(2) intends to cause serious bodily injury and commits an act clearly dangerous to human life that causes the death of an individual; ...\"\n[2]  Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966).\n[3]  Omitting the warnings and formal parts, appellant's extrajudicial confession reads as follows:\n\nI would like to state, that Friday, 2/10/78, at around 5:30 P.M. I was at home with my two brothers, Andrew, Roland, my son Juan and my daughter Valerie. All four of them were outside playing and it was getting late, so I called them, to come inside. They all came inside the house, went to the bathroom and closed the door. I started wondering, what they were doing inside the bathroom, so I opened the door. I saw Valerie, hugging and kissing my son Juan. I hate for her to kiss him and I have told her many times not to kiss him, because it makes me mad, he is only three years old. I then grabbed Valerie by the arm and took her inside my bedroom and then slapped her on the face, several times. Then I got a belt and I hit her several times with it, all over her body, head, arms, legs, etc. I don't know how many times I hit her, but I do know, it was a lot of times. I then stopped hitting her with the belt but I was still mad at her. She kept on screaming and crying and when I told her to be quiet, she kept on and would not stop. So, then I got a board, that we use to bolt the door with, to keep it from opening. I then hit her with it a lot of times, all over her body and did not stop hitting her, until she stopped screaming. I don't remember how many times I hit her, but I do know I hit her for a long time. She laid down on the mattress, after I stopped hitting her and she went to sleep.\nI then got scared, because I thought I might have hurt her and I tried to wake her up. I could'nt [sic] get her to wake up and this is when I went outside, walked to a nearby garage and told the mechanic to call an ambulance, that my baby was sick. I then went home and waited for the ambulance. After a few minutes, E.M.S. and the Police arrived. I told them that my baby had accidently drank Pine Sol and did not tell them the truth, because I was scared. The E.M.S. men, then took me and my baby to the Bexar County Hospital and later on, a Police officer, took me to the Homicide Office. There I talked to the Detectives and I told them that my husband Francisco Rodriguez, who is in Mexico, had beat up my daughter. He was always hitting her, the last time he came to visit us and this was about three weeks ago.\nThis is the truth and exactly what happened to my daughter. I have not been promised anything for giving this statement. This statement was read back to me in english [sic] by Sgt. L. Brown, because I do not know how to read in english [sic]. Everything he has read back to me is exactly what I told Det. Juarez and it is the truth.\n[4]  They are not photographs taken after an autopsy. Cf. Terry v. State, 491 S.W.2d 161 (Tex. Cr.App.1973).\n[5]  378 U.S. 368, 84 S.Ct. 1774, 12 L.Ed.2d 908 (1964).\n[6]  The trial court in its findings refers to the appellant as both, defendant and appellant.\n", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "FreeLaw"}}

Murray HENDERSON, Warden, Louisiana State Penitentiary,Respondent-Appellee.\nNo. 72-2516 Summary Calendar.*\nUnited States Court of Appeals,Fifth Circuit.\nJan. 16, 1973.\n\nLawrence A. Durant, Baton Rouge, La.  (Court-appointed), for petitioner-appellant.\nWilliam P. Guste, Atty. Gen., S. J. Dileo, Jr., Asst. Atty. Gen., L. J. Hymel, Jr., Baton Rouge, La., for respondent-appellee.\nBefore JOHN R. BROWN, Chief Judge, and GOLDBERG and MORGAN, Circuit Judges.\nPER CURIAM:\n\n\n1\nWhile serving a 15-year sentence for an unrelated crime, petitioner and a fellow inmate in the Louisiana State Prison where he was incarcerated became embroiled in a heated quarrel.  During the course of the fight that ensued, petitioner pulled a knife from underneath his pillow and stabbed his card partner to death.\n\n\n2\nPetitioner was indicted for first degree murder as a result of his action and was arraigned, tried, convicted, and sentenced to life imprisonment on November 9, 1962.  The only people present at petitioner's trial were the trial judge, the prosecuting attorney, and a recorder who jotted down minute notes of the proceedings.  Those notes indicate that the petitioner waived his right to counsel, pled guilty to murder (thereby waiving other precious Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights) and waived the mandatory 24-hour delay provided by statute between conviction and sentencing in this proceeding.\n\n\n3\nUpon petitioner's application for a writ of habeas corpus, the district court below granted an evidentiary hearing and allowed the petitioner to present evidence from two psychiatrists who had examined him.  Both doctors testified that he could have intelligently understood the magnitude of his action if-and only if-they were simply and clearly explained.  The court below found the minute entries indicating that the petitioner had waived his constitutional rights to be controlling.  We disagree.\n\n\n4\nIn short, this is what the record demonstrates: a nonverbatim minute report taken during the defendant's trial indicates that a marginally competent inmate pleaded guilty to murdering a fellow inmate under circumstances which could have been manslaughter, if not justifiable homicide, and received a life sentence without so much as a bat of the eye.  This conduct does not comport with the stringent due process requirements imposed upon the states by Boykin v. Alabama, 1969, 395 U.S. 238, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274.\n\n\n5\nThere is a strong presumption against the waiver of vital constitutional rights.  Upon the record before us, we are unable to state that the defendant intelligently and voluntarily abandoned a known constitutional right or privilege.  Johnson v. Zerbst, 1938, 304 U.S. 458, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461.  Therefore, petitioner must be given the opportunity to plead anew.\n\n\n6\nReversed and remanded.\n\n\n\n*\n Rule 18, 5 Cir.; see Isbell Enterprises, Inc. v.

{"text": "Special Reports\n\nQuantum computing: Same plot, shorter film\n\nIBM (NYSE: IBM) states that its quantum computing architecture will eclipse anything classical computing can produce once it can entangle 50 quantum bits (qubits). When IBM announced its quantum cloud service in March 2017, it sat at 5 qubits; by June it had reached 16 qubits. This development trajectory suggests the IBM Q Series will eclipse classical computing in two to three years. On the other hand, quantum pure play D-Wave recently released a system doubling the qubit performance from 1,000 to 2,000. The differences between the two architectures are nuanced and reminiscent of the high-performance computing development arcs of the past 40 years. In classical computing, niche vendors such as Cray and Tandem innovated around special-purpose computers addressing mission-critical, niche applications before general-purpose computing architectures could provide the same compute output at commercially acceptable price points.

{"text": "I make mention here & there about friends & families expecting handouts when you start a new business that might be beneficial to them. I also make mention of the creative professional job field and how it\u2019s often not taken seriously. Some of the posts are a little snarky and angsty, let\u2019s be real. I\u2019ll admit it. This time, though, I really want to explain why friends and family can have a very negative, detrimental effect on your business when they expect freebies. I\u2019ve had real-life experience with how to handle friends + family that don\u2019t want to pay.\n\nLet\u2019s start with this: the expectation placed upon you as a new or growing business to provide goods and services for your family and friends is frustrating, is it not? You have this awesome new product that you can\u2019t wait to show people. You know it\u2019s going to be a total hit, and you\u2019re filled with excitement over releasing this new thing. And then, your pal says, \u201cMan, that\u2019s awesome! Say, if you send one of those my way, I\u2019ll be sure to mention where I got it from.\u201d There\u2019s the ever popular, \u201cBut I can give you exposure!\u201d And the excitement vanishes, because you have a pit in your stomach over the uncomfortable position you\u2019ve suddenly been thrust into.\n\nDo you attempt to put on a smile, be positive, and thank your friend, sending the stuff their way, knowing that it\u2019s not how you intended for it to be received? Or do you politely decline, and feel really weird about telling your pal that they have to pay for it?\n\nLet\u2019s say that you send it even though you didn\u2019t intend for it be this way. What\u2019s the positive here? Sure, your pal could promote the hell out of this awesome new thing for you and bring some business your way. That\u2019s great, right? (And totally uncommon.) But what about the underlying, unsaid thing? You know\u2026 where your friend [may have inadvertently] devalued your hard work by asking for this thing for free. *gasp!* I said it. You didn\u2019t really want to send it, you didn\u2019t really want to give it away for free, and now you have this really weird feeling and you can\u2019t put your finger on it. Pretty sure that\u2019s the feeling of hard work not being appreciated.\n\nAs a business owner and instant customer service rep, you\u2019re going to feel the pull of obligation to do what you\u2019re asked. Declining or refusing would be rude, right? They might say bad things about you, right? And they said they\u2019d put in a good word for you, right?\n\nWRONG. The fact that your pal even asked you is the rude part.\n\nHere\u2019s why.\n\nConfidence.\n\nYour friend may very well have good intentions in asking for this thing from you with the intent of helping you out. Let\u2019s get that straight. MOST of the time, there are good intentions. However, asking for this thing for free, and then qualifying it with any number of statements about referrals, recommendations, free exposure will really shake a person\u2019s confidence. You probably don\u2019t even realize that you\u2019re subconsciously starting to question yourself. Is what I\u2019m doing not worth payment? Is it a good idea, but not good enough for people to pay me for it? Does my friend think it\u2019s not worth the price I\u2019m asking?\n\nCost.\n\nRunning a business ain\u2019t cheap. You know it, I know it. In order to make money, you often have to spend money. And a whole lot of time. Unless you have a solid plan to release a number of your items for free, and it\u2019s in your budget, it\u2019s expensive. I\u2019ve felt obligated, more than once, to provide a service to a friend with the hope of referrals. I\u2019ll admit it, and that\u2019s why I can sit here and tell y\u2019all that it\u2019s a bad idea.\n\nWhat happened next was shocking. (That sounds like clickbait, doesn\u2019t it?)\n\nThe referrals I received expected the same freebie treatment. They legitimately said, \u201cYou gave it to so-and-so like this, I was hoping you\u2019d be able to do the same.\u201d\n\nWe settled on a discounted rate in the end. I sank a lot of time into something that was worth a lot more than what I received. See? Costly.\n\nExpectation.\n\nProviding a freebie when you would normally be paid for it creates an expectation that you will always provide a freebie. They will expect the same to always occur, more often than not. Then, you\u2019re stuck in a hard position. Do you feed the expectation in order to keep the peace, or do you push back and feel that you\u2019re risking a relationship? Let\u2019s face it. If you feel that you\u2019re risking a relationship by saying no, it\u2019s probably not a relationship you want to carry on with a person. Friends & family, please don\u2019t put your favorite business owner in this position!\n\nThere\u2019s really no winner in a situation like this, where someone expects or requests free products or services.\n\nIf you\u2019re a friend or a family of a business owner, the best way that you can support them is to support their business by feeding it. If they have something that is useful to you, whether it\u2019s a product or service, stand behind them by being a patron and full supporter. It means a lot to a business owner to know that someone they\u2019re close to is willing to support them. One good way to support them is by paying for the product or service, rather than expecting a handout. In fact, it means a lot more than any client they didn\u2019t have a previous relationship with. It shows that you value their work and the time they\u2019ve spent. It also keeps both of you out of an awkward position.\n\nYou are not alone, business owner, if this is happening to you. My best recommendation is to stick to your guns. If you feel weird, awkward, or like you\u2019re being used, you should politely pass on the opportunity. You spend countless hours working toward what you have going on, so you should be treated like it!", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "Pile-CC"}}

{"text": "Estimating trends in the effectiveness of seat belts in saving lives, 1975-1985.\nWe examine the effectiveness of seat-belt systems for preventing mortality in automobile crashes. In particular, we examine whether seat-belt effectiveness has been constant over this period and conclude that there has been a trend toward an increased effectiveness of seat-belt systems. The relative odds of death associated with wearing seat belts dropped from 0.80 in 1975 to 0.34 in 1985. This trend results from improvements in both the type and design of seat belts and from additional design changes, such as padded dashboards and collapsible steering columns, that protect occupants at the time of collision.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "PubMed Abstracts"}}

{"text": "Association of prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 gene polymorphisms with asthma and atopy in Chinese children.\nCyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) plays essential roles in inflammation. Previous studies have suggested associations between prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2) polymorphisms and prostaglandins production in asthma. We have investigated the effects of Chinese tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of PTGS2 on asthma traits in 299 Chinese asthmatic children and 175 controls. Plasma total and allergen-specific IgE were measured by enzyme immunoassay. PTGS2.8473T-->C in the 3'-untranslated region of exon 10 and three tag SNPs covering most of the variations in PTGS2 haplotypes in Chinese were genotyped by restriction fragment length polymorphism. Among the four SNPs, only PTGS2.8473 showed significant association with asthma (P = 0.034) and atopy (P = 0.005 when compared with non-atopic controls; P = 0.023 with all controls). Carriers of the C allele had a 1.5-fold (95% confidence interval: 1.01-2.30) risk of developing asthma than those homozygous for the T allele. Multivariate regression revealed significant correlations between PTGS2.8473 and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1); P = 0.002) and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR; P = 0.001) with age and gender adjusted. Patients with the C allele of PTGS2.8473 had significantly lower FEV(1) (median: 90.0%vs 98.0%; P = 0.0047) and PEFR (70.0%vs 73.5%; P = 0.0065) than those homozygous for the T allele. No significant association between plasma total and allergen-specific IgE and these SNPs or with their haplotypes was found. PTGS2.8473 polymorphism is associated with asthma, atopy and lung function but not plasma IgE in Chinese children. This may help to explore the pharmacogenetics of COX-2 inhibitors.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "PubMed Abstracts"}}
{"text": "An ethical leadership program for nursing unit managers.\nThe aims of this study were to evaluate the effect of an ethical leadership program (ELP) on ethical leadership, organizational citizenship behavior (OCB), and job outcomes of nursing unit managers (UMs) and to examine changes in staff nurses' perception about UMs' EL, OCB, job outcomes, and ethical work environments (EWEs) post-ELP. A quasi-experimental (pre- and post-test design) study conducted six-month intervention (ELP) using self-reported UM survey (n=44), and staff nurses (n=158) were randomly extracted by two steps. The Korean version of Ethical Leadership at Work for UMs' self-ethical leadership, the Ethical Leadership Scale for staff nurses' perceived ethical leadership, a 19-item OCB scale, and six dimensions of the medium-sized Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire II for job outcomes and EWEs were administered at baseline and post-intervention. UMs' ethical leadership scores differed significantly over time in people orientation (p=0.041) and concern for ethical leadership sustainability (p=0.002) adjusting for UM experience duration and nursing unit type. Total mean and level of power-sharing of ethical leadership among UMs with <5years of UM experience improved significantly over time. Of staff nurses' perception changes about UMs' ethical leadership, OCB, job outcomes, and EWEs, significant improvement over time appeared only in EWEs' work influence level (p=0.007). This study provides useful information for clinical ELP development and examining the program's effect on leadership skills and followers' outcomes. Program facilitation relies on practical training methods, participant motivation, and assessment outcome designs by controlling clinical confounding factors. Findings have implications as an attempt for intervention to promote competencies related to ethical leadership of nursing unit managers.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "PubMed Abstracts"}}

{"text": "Post navigation\n\nLiquor Licensees Look To Expose LCB\u2019s \u201cBig Lie\u201d\n\nOCEAN CITY \u2014 After weeks of sitting back and watching the Liquor Control Board for Worcester County (LCB) go on the defensive, the county\u2019s licensees threw a counter punch on Wednesday by revealing that they aren\u2019t the only ones who have been paying too much for their liquor.\n\nAt a press conference at the Buxy\u2019s Salty Dog Saloon in Ocean City, Worcester County License Beverage Association (WCLBA) President Doug Buxbaum tried to poke holes in what he called \u201cthe big lie the LCB has always loved to tell\u201d, concerning the LCB\u2019s prices to not only the licensees but also the people of Worcester County.\n\n\u201c[The LCB] has taken advantage of their power for too long as they have been gouging the residents and the licensees all along when they have claimed to be trying to help us,\u201d said Buxbaum. \u201cWe are trying to once and for all dispute and put an end to the spew of misinformation.\u201d\n\nBuxbaum presented figures and a handful of examples that showed that the residents and the licensees of Worcester County have been paying heftier prices at both the retail and the wholesale level than those in neighboring Wicomico County. He also showed that despite the LCB\u2019s claim that it has been losing hundreds of thousands of dollars because of the poor economy, added costs, and lower prices, its gross profits have risen each year since 2006.\n\n\u201cFor a bottle of Don Julio tequila for instance, the Maryland Beverage Journal price is $29.99,\u201d said Buxbaum. \u201cIf you were to buy it in a retail store, off the shelf in Worcester County, you would pay $52.99 for it, or a $23 or 77% markup. In Wicomico County, you would pay $48.99 for the same bottle.\u201d\n\nFurther price comparisons between the two counties showed that Worcester has in some cases, as much as 28% higher prices than that of Wicomico County, even though the Maryland State Law requires suppliers or wholesalers to sell liquor to the state\u2019s four county dispensaries (Worcester and Wicomico, as well as Somerset and Montgomery) at the exact same price.\n\nLast week, LCB Executive Director Brian Sturgeon said publicly that the dwindling revenues that the quasi governmental monopoly has returned to Worcester County was largely based on an across the board drop in pricing structure last year, as per a request from the County Commissioners, and an increase in the LCB\u2019s operational costs.\n\n\u201cWe lowered our prices to help the licensees and when we finally saw the numbers that came in for our contribution to the county for this year, we thought, damn, we have to do something to fix this, because we made a huge mistake and lowered the prices too much,\u201d said Sturgeon.\n\nThe $110,000 that the LCB reportedly returned to Worcester County is the lowest total in well over a decade and is just a mere fraction of the almost $900,000 that was returned to the county in 2003 and far short of the approximated $777,000 given back just two years ago.\n\n\u201cEveryone knows that you can\u2019t continue to run a business the way they have been,\u201d said Buxbaum. \u201cIf I lost that much money, I would be on the street, and so would all of you in this audience. We feel that the pricing is causing people to go to Delaware or to other places in the state to buy their liquor, and we want to keep the business in this county to help the people who live here. It\u2019s just another glaring reason why Worcester County needs to get out of the liquor business.\u201d\n\nBuxbaum said that the relationship between the LCB and the local licensees started to sour last year, when he says, the board arbitrarily elected to raise markup prices from 18% to 22%, but he noted that things really got heated last March when the LCB ran a $5 special promotion for bottles of Stolichnaya vodka, but didn\u2019t offer the deal to everyone.\n\n\u201cWe, as licensees, have to be prepared for continued price increases,\u201d said Buxbaum. \u201cWe are considering a class action suit against the LCB for unfair pricing schemes and for not offering the deal to all the licensees as they are required to by law. They say that they did, but the fact is that they didn\u2019t. In all the cases where they say that they were trying to help us, they have showed no proof. It\u2019s just been words, and at best, half truths.\u201d\n\nIf abolished, the licensees of Worcester County would see about 25% coming back to their proverbial bottom lines, but according to some licensees in attendance on Wednesday, the biggest impact could be on both the revenue returned to the county.\n\n\u201cTheir six stores don\u2019t pay taxes on inventory or personal property tax,\u201d said Buxbaum. \u201cSo that alone, if those stores became private enterprise, would recoup more than six figures to the county.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the WCLBA will be pitching the merits of having an economic impact study done by the Worcester County Commissioners in hopes of having a plan in place to replace the revenue given back to the county annually. According to those on the licensee side of the debate, the way to replace the revenue seems to be the lone subject where they aren\u2019t quite yet in a seemingly unified voice.\n\nDuring Wednesday\u2019s press conference, Buxbaum also took umbrage with LCB Chairman Don Hastings\u2019 claim that only \u201csix or seven licensees out of 187 were the ones trying to get them abolished\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are more than 100 members strong at the WCLBA, and we are all together in our belief that the train is on the track and it\u2019s time for the LCB to go, once and for all,\u201d said Buxbaum.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "Pile-CC"}}
{"text": "Fault Lines: How Hidden Fractures Still Threaten the World's Economy\n\nRaghuram Rajan was one of the few economists who warned of the global financial crisis before it hit. Now, as the world struggles to recover, it's tempting to blame what happened on just a few greedy bankers who took irrational risks and left the rest of us to foot the bill. In Fault Lines, Rajan argues that serious flaws in the economy are also to blame, and warns that a potentially more devastating crisis awaits us if they aren't fixed.\n\nThe Euro: How a Common Currency Threatens the Future of Europe\n\nIn The Euro, Nobel Prize-winning economist and best-selling author Joseph E. Stiglitz dismantles the prevailing consensus around what ails Europe, demolishing the champions of austerity while offering a series of plans that can rescue the continent - and the world - from further devastation. Hailed by its architects as a lever that would bring Europe together and promote prosperity, the euro has done the opposite. As Stiglitz persuasively argues, the crises revealed the shortcomings of the euro.\n\nStress Test: Reflections on Financial Crises\n\nOn January 26, 2009, during the depth of the financial crisis and having just completed five years as President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Timothy F.

Bernanke was appointed chair of the Federal Reserve, capping a meteoric trajectory from a rural South Carolina childhood to professorships at Stanford and Princeton, to public service in Washington's halls of power.

Thaler has spent his career studying the radical notion that the central agents in the economy are humans - predictable, error-prone individuals. Misbehaving is his arresting, frequently hilarious account of the struggle to bring an academic discipline back down to earth - and change the way we think about economics, ourselves, and our world.\n\nJay Friedman says:\"Great book if it's your first about Behav. Econ\"\n\nPublisher's Summary\n\nIn the fall of 2008, 15 of the world's leading economists - representing the broadest spectrum of economic opinion - gathered at New Hampshire's Squam Lake. Their goal: the mapping of a long-term plan for financial regulation reform.\n\nThe Squam Lake Report distills the wealth of insights from the ongoing collaboration that began at these meetings and provides a revelatory, unified, and coherent voice for fixing our troubled and damaged financial markets. As an alternative to the patchwork solutions and ideologically charged proposals that have dominated other discussions, the Squam Lake group sets forth a clear nonpartisan plan of action to transform the regulation of financial markets - not just for the current climate - but for generations to come.\n\nThey look at the critical holes in the existing regulatory framework for handling complex financial institutions, retirement savings, and credit-default swaps. They offer ideas for new financial instruments designed to recapitalize banks without burdening taxpayers. To lower the risk that large banks will fail, the authors call for higher capital requirements as well as a systemic regulator who is part of the central bank. They collectively analyze where the financial system has failed, and how these weak points should be overhauled.\n\nCombining an immense depth of academic, private sector, and public policy experience, The Squam Lake Report contains urgent recommendations that will positively influence everyone's financial well-being - all who care about the world's economic health need to pay attention.\n\nWhat the Critics Say\n\n\"If you asked me to recommend one thing to read on reforming financial regulation, [The Squam Lake Report] would be it.

Clinically relevant disturbances (co-) caused by a relative testosterone-deficit are: changes of body composition (increase of fat mass, decrease of lean tissue mass), decrease of muscle strength and mass, changes of the lipid profile, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis and anemia. Controlled studies revealed a positive effect of testosterone substitution on body composition, muscle strength, bone metabolism and erythropoesis. Moreover, a protective effect on the development of coronary artery disease could be demonstrated by an improvement of the lipid profile, decrease of obesity and insulin resistance and by a direct effect on the coronary vessels. Clinically evident hypogonadism is a clear indication for testosterone-substitution also in the ageing male, whereas in the case of the partial testosterone-deficit in the absence of sufficient data at this time no general recommendation for substitution can be given; one has to decide about a (experimental) therapy in the individual patient. In every case the contraindications of a testosterone-supplementation (carcinoma of the prostate, elevated PSA-values, polyglobulia, sleep-apnea-syndrome) have to be observed, a continuous survey of the therapy, especially of the prostate is essential.

She served the French Navy for several years carrying dispatches until in 1793  and  captured her off J\u00e9r\u00e9mie. The Royal Navy took her into service briefly as Goelan and sold her in 1794. As the merchant brig Brothers she appears to have sailed as a whaling ship in the South Seas Whale Fisheries until 1808 or so, and then traded between London and the . She is no longer listed after 1815.\n\nFrench service\nLieutenant de vaisseau Le Tourneur carried dispatches from Brest to Newfoundland and St Pierre (probably Saint Pierre and Miquelon) on a voyage that lasted from 12 June 1790 until 3 November. The renowned French naval officer, Jean-Marthe-Adrien l'Hermite served on her as a junior officer on one of these voyages when she escorted the fishing fleet from Granville to Newfoundland.\n\nOn 12 September 1791 Go\u00e9land was at Brest, under the command of sous-lieutenant de vaisseau Le Dall de Kerangalet.\n\nIn April 1793 Go\u00e9land was sailing from Cap-Fran\u00e7ais to J\u00e9r\u00e9mie while under the command of lieutenant de vaisseau Leiss\u00e8gues de Pennenyum. Early on the 16th Leiss\u00e8gues was seeking to enter the bay while searching for a convoy he was to escort when he observed an enemy frigate at the entrance. The British frigate immediately set out to drive Go\u00e9land on shore. At 7a.m. she received her first shots and by 9.a.m. the British frigate was no more than pistol-shot away. Go\u00e9land fired back, but resistance was futile. Leiss\u00e8gues was forced to strike to the frigate Penelope. Proserpine shared with Penelope in the prize money, suggesting that she was in company with Penelope, or in sight.\n\nRoyal Navy\nThe British took Go\u00e9land into service as Goelan. Commander Thomas Wolley was appointed Goelans captain at Jamaica.\n \nIn September 1793, at the request of French Royalists, Commodore John Ford took a squadron and attacked Saint-Domingue and J\u00e9r\u00e9mie in the Caribbean. On 23 September 1793 the British captured four merchant vessels at L'Islet, and on the 29th seven at Flamande Bay. At M\u00f4le-Saint-Nicolas, on 23 September, , Goelan, and  captured the Convention Nationale, among other vessels.\n\nIn December command passed to Lieutenant George Hopewell Stephens (temp), who sailed Goelan to Portsmouth, arriving on 27 August 1794.\n\nWhaling\nGoelan was offered for sale at Sheerness in 1794. She was sold at Portsmouth on 16 October 1794 for \u00a3590.

She sailed in February 1796 and returned in December. She was reported off the coast of Brazil in January 1797, returning to Britain in 1797 and sailing again in October.\n\nUnder Captain William Smith she was employed in the South Sea Whale Fishery in 1798. She was on the protection list for 1799, returning in May.\n\nLloyd's Register for 1799 shows a Brothers, French-built, 13 years old, and 242 tons (bm).

The information in Lloyd's Register is not entirely consistent with that from other sources for the period 1799 to 1808, but does overlap them to a great degree.\n\nCaptain Thomas Folger sailed Brothers to the South Seas in October 1802. At that time she was valued at \u00a35,5000. She was reported \"all well\" off the coast of Chile in March 1803.

{"text": "One city in India is swapping its cars for bikes.\n\nWRI India and Nagarro Software, in partnership with Udaan NGO and NASSCOM Foundation, recently launched the Seeds for Change project in Gurugram, India, reclaiming four car parking spots to make space for 40 bicycles. The initiative, modelled after the country\u2019s car-free \u201cRaahgiri Days,\u201d plans to replicate the pilot project in other parking lots throughout the city over the coming months.\n\nBy swapping car parking spaces for the humble cycle, Gurugram has taken a step toward a more sustainable future. While it\u2019s a small step, this is the country\u2019s first \u201cpocket parking\u201d initiative, which could lead to bigger changes in city planning.\n\nA big deterrent to cycling, apart from safe streets, is safe spaces to park, as most spaces are taken up by car and motorcycle parking. The re-imagining of parking space for bikes will not only sensitize people towards walking and cycling, but will pave the way for creating cities for people rather than vehicles.\n\nFewer Cars, Better Cities\n\nRoughly 300,000 cars enter Gurugram every day, and an equal number exist within the city. With more than 600,000 cars on the streets, traffic congestion is an obvious byproduct.\n\nSo are air pollution and road traffic crashes. All these cars are one reason why the city has seen a severe to very unhealthy air quality index and records around 450 road traffic deaths per year.\n\nThe Seeds for Change initiative is part of a larger concept known as \u201ctactical urbanism.\u201d It allows stakeholders and locals to work on new concepts without substantial political and financial commitments. The actions can be temporary or permanent, depending on the need of the location. Across the world, this movement is also referred to as \u201ccity repair,\u201d \u201cguerilla urbanism,\u201d \u201cpop-up urbanism,\u201d or \u201cDIY urbanism.\u201d\n\nWhile Gurugram is the first city in India to pursue tactical urbanism to shift transport from cars to cleaner transport modes, it\u2019s already proven successful in other cities around the world. Car-shaped racks were installed at a parking spot in Buenos Aires to reclaim space for 10 bicycles; they then caught the attention of authorities, who increased the initiative to include 40-such cycle parking spaces. The city of Sao Paulo, Brazil made permanent mini public parks from parking spots along the roadside, providing a safe space for cyclists and walkers. City authorities in San Francisco designed some areas with sharp corners as seating spaces with planters. One NGO in Mexico introduced similar mobile parks, or \u201cparklets on wheels,\u201d to create safe public spaces.\n\nThe Seeds for Change project in Gurugram, India, reclaimed four car parking spots to make space for 40 bicycles. Photo by Amit Bhatt/WRI\n\nSmall Changes for Bigger Impact\n\nBut perhaps what\u2019s most exciting about Seeds for Change\u2014and tactical urbanism more broadly\u2014is the potential for success and replicability.\n\nThis technique brings about miniscule pop-ups that are striking and easily noticed by people, yet do not disturb daily life with large-scale changes. It also doesn\u2019t require a huge amount of financing.\n\nThe project includes all stakeholders since the conception. The process of implementing a tactical urbanism project brings people on streets to experience its dynamics. They take charge of designing their environment, and feel responsible for its success and maintenance. Each stakeholder may have an individual solution, which can be synchronized in one design.\n\nAnd finally, there\u2019s a complete focus on place-making. While Gurugram has several private buildings like the Signature Tower and Gateway Tower as its landmarks, it lacks public spaces such as a Connaught Circle of Delhi or a Times Square of New York. Seeds for Change gives identity to the spaces around the city, creating an image and allowing people to identify with it. This brings a sense of belongingness to the public spaces that are accessible to all.\n\nSeeds for Change can start the conversation on cities\u2019 prioritizing people over cars. Citizens will identify with city corners, and will become responsible for them. This makes it more likely for vibrancy and greenery to increase, transforming formerly car-centric areas into safe spaces. And throughout India, the tactical urbanism movement can become an example of urban renewal via small-scale interventions.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease: The Legacy of the Cholinergic Hypothesis, Neuroplasticity, and Future Directions.\nIn this issue, an article by Waring et al. provides a meta-analysis of the effects of apo-lipo-protein E (APOE) genotype on the beneficial effect of acetyl-cholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). There was no significant effect found. As of 2015, AChEI medications are the mainstay of AD treatment, and APOE genotype is the most significant factor associated with AD causation. This lack of a significant effect of APOE is analyzed with respect to the \"Cholinergic Hypothesis\" of AD, dating from 1976, through the recognition that cholinergic neurons are not the sole target of AD, but rather that AD attacks all levels of neuroplasticity in the brain, an idea originated by Ashford and Jarvik in 1985 and which still provides the clearest explanation for AD dementia. The \"Amyloid Hypothesis\" is dissected back to the alpha/beta pathway switching mechanism affecting the nexin-amyloid pre-protein (NAPP switch). The NAPP switch may be the critical neuroplasticity component of all learning involving synapse remodeling and subserve all learning mechanisms. The gamma-secretase cleavage is discussed, and its normal complementary products, beta-amyloid and the NAPP intracellular domain (NAICD), appear to be involved in natural synapse removal, but the link to AD dementia may involve the NAICD rather than beta-amyloid. Understanding neuroplasticity and the critical pathways to AD dementia are needed to determine therapies and preventive strategies for AD. In particular, the effect of APOE on AD predisposition needs to be established and a means found to adjust its effect to prevent AD.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "PubMed Abstracts"}}

{"text": "Psychophysical \"blinding\" methods reveal a functional hierarchy of unconscious visual processing.\nNumerous non-invasive experimental \"blinding\" methods exist for suppressing the phenomenal awareness of visual stimuli. Not all of these suppressive methods occur at, and thus index, the same level of unconscious visual processing. This suggests that a functional hierarchy of unconscious visual processing can in principle be established. The empirical results of extant studies that have used a number of different methods and additional reasonable theoretical considerations suggest the following tentative hierarchy. At the highest levels in this hierarchy is unconscious processing indexed by object-substitution masking. The functional levels indexed by crowding, the attentional blink (and other attentional blinding methods), backward pattern masking, metacontrast masking, continuous flash suppression, sandwich masking, and single-flash interocular suppression, fall at progressively lower levels, while unconscious processing at the lowest levels is indexed by eye-based binocular-rivalry suppression. Although unconscious processing levels indexed by additional blinding methods is yet to be determined, a tentative placement at lower levels in the hierarchy is also given for unconscious processing indexed by Troxler fading and adaptation-induced blindness, and at higher levels in the hierarchy indexed by attentional blinding effects in addition to the level indexed by the attentional blink. The full mapping of levels in the functional hierarchy onto cortical activation sites and levels is yet to be determined.

{"text": "Background {#Sec1}\n==========\n\nThe functional independence of individuals after stroke is directly influenced by the ability to perform reaching and grasping movements successfully \\[[@CR1]\\]. However, the performance of these motor activities is commonly affected after stroke, leading to slower and segmented movements, and these, in turn, may be associated with compensatory movements of structures such as the shoulder and trunk \\[[@CR2]\\].\n\nReach and grasp movements involve the coordination of the fingers and thumb, previously positioned according to the size, shape, and function of the object that are combined with the movement of the arm toward the object and the control of the force to hold the target and keep it in the hand during its transport \\[[@CR1], [@CR3]\\].\n\nSeveral conventional and standardized clinical measures aim to evaluate reach and grasp activities in post-stroke subjects \\[[@CR4]\\]. Instruments, such as the Fugl Meyer Functional Performance Scale (FM), Box and Blocks Test (BBT), and Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), aim to quantify movement changes through observational analyses, further classified on either ordinal or nominal scales \\[[@CR2], [@CR5]\\].\n\nThe assessment of reach and grasp through clinical tests, when applied by trained professionals, allows the verification of psychometric properties and their effects on daily activities. In addition, the evaluation uses instruments that are inexpensive, simple, and quick to apply \\[[@CR6]\\]. However, the results of these instruments have a gap for control and measurement of procedures to provide more meaningful and detailed results, not only for distinguishing different patterns of impairment and compensation strategies but also for analyzing follow-up during treatment of these motor activities \\[[@CR2], [@CR7]\\].\n\nKinematic laboratory analyses allow the objective and precise examination of the points that need to be addressed to improve reach and grasp movements \\[[@CR7], [@CR8]\\]. These instruments analyze temporal variables that are not observed directly by clinical instruments. However, the kinematic assessment available and consolidated products are costly \\[[@CR9], [@CR10]\\].\n\nFor this reason, because of the scarcity of free or low-cost equipment, it is necessary to improve studies involving the construction of devices that allow evaluations of different parameters of reach and grasp movements using conventional clinical instruments for clinical and scientific purposes.\n\nTherefore, the aim of this study was to develop an inexpensive, manageable tool for assessing reach and grasp movements that enables the analysis of aspects not addressed by conventional clinical measures and provides an alternative to expensive kinematic analysis equipment.\n\nResults {#Sec2}\n=======\n\nThe data related to the sample characterization are shown in Table\u00a0[1](#Tab1){ref-type=\"table\"}.Table\u00a01Demographics and clinical characteristics of participants (*n*\u2009=\u20098)CharacteristicValue*n* (%)Median (1Q/3Q)Sex, *n* (%)\u00a0Female3 (37.5)\u00a0Male5 (62.5)Age, in years66 (59/68.75)Time onset stroke, in months44 (11.25/93.00)Affected hand, *n* (%)\u00a0Right5 (62.5)\u00a0Left3 (37.5)FMA-UE50 (44.75/54.25)Nottingham Sensorial test150.5 (138.5/153.25)MMSE25 (21/28.25)REACH close target17.5 (11.75/18)REACH distant target16 (11.75/17.25)BBT33 (21.25/37.5)ARAT55 (48.75/56.25)All subjects were ischemic strokeAll subjects were right-handed*n* number, *1Q* first quarter, *3Q* third quarter, *FMA*-*UE* Fugl Meyer Assessment for the Upper Extremity, *MMSE* Mini-Mental Status Examination\n\nIn Table\u00a0[2](#Tab2){ref-type=\"table\"}, the kinematic variables obtained by the TDAI system showed better performance in the time and in the velocity aspects when comparing the results between the most affected limb and the least affected limb, related to task 1.Table\u00a02Comparison of motor performance with paretic and non-paretic limb in the accomplishment of task 1VariableMann--Whitney testParetic limb\\\nMedian (1Q/3Q)Non-paretic limb\\\nMedian (1Q/3Q)Time3.34 (2.94/3.78)2.77 (2.58/2.91)\\*Time target 11.36 (1.12/1.50)1.18 (0.94/1.25)Time target 22.27 (2.05/2.57)2.00 (1.65/2.13)Time target 33.37 (2.98/3.80)2.80 (2.58/2.91)\\*Velocity 134.34 (29.43/43.04)40.12 (39.51/48.39)Velocity 218.57 (14.31/22.18)21.87 (18.94/23.34)Velocity 37.08 (5.94/9.71)11.09 (9.52/11.75)\\*Acceleration 149.40 (45.18/85.66)78.40 (70.78/105.87)Acceleration 258.75 (30.28/75.42)68.77 (53.12/85.63)Acceleration 315.83 (11.53/40.93)32.78 (25.11/39.13)Effectiveness100%100%*1Q* first quarter, *3Q* third quarter\\**p* values: level of significance:\u2009\u2264\u20090.05\n\nWhile in task 2 (Table\u00a0[3](#Tab3){ref-type=\"table\"}), the velocity variable obtained significant difference between the upper limbs.Table\u00a03Comparison of motor performance with paretic and non-paretic limb in the accomplishment of task 2VariableMann--Whitney testParetic limb\\\nMedian (1Q/3Q)Non-paretic limb\\\nMedian (1Q/3Q)Time2.54 (2.26/3.87)2.36 (2.25/2.82)Time target 11.52 (1.23/2.36)1.44 (1.29/1.65)Time target 22.54 (2.26/3.87)2.36 (2.22/2.82)Velocity 130.07 (21.47/37.24)35.55 (30.71/39.58)Velocity 212.91 (10.29/15.19)19.29 (14.92/23.38)\\*Acceleration 140.49 (23.55/65.99)55.33 (42.66/69.00)Acceleration 228.75 (20.25/35.49)44.80 (35.26/66.49)Effectiveness100%100%*1Q* first quarter, *3Q* third quarter\\**p* values: level of significance:\u2009\u2264\u20090.05\n\nThe kinematic variables in tasks 1 showed some correlation with the clinical instruments used, as shown in Table\u00a0[4](#Tab4){ref-type=\"table\"}.

Conventional clinical evaluations usually use daily activities, as well as being practical and for standard application. However, they have superficial and limited results, as they are little subject to the subtle alterations and may not be sensitive enough to identify the residual deficits in these patients \\[[@CR6], [@CR7], [@CR11]--[@CR16]\\].\n\nKinematic assessment instruments, in turn, promote more detailed, objective, and accurate measurement \\[[@CR2], [@CR6], [@CR17]\\]. However, they are expensive, bulky pieces of equipment that require time to adjust and calibrate, making them less practical for use in clinical or laboratory daily life \\[[@CR7], [@CR9]\\].\n\nThis study proposed to develop a system that had simple handling, easy displacement, fast application in the clinical environment, and low cost. The TDAI achieved this goal. Out equipment can be quickly assembled and disassembled in less than 5\u00a0min, and weighs about 300 g, making it easy to transport and was built with less than \\$25. No time is required for calibration, and UE assessment can be applied in 20--30\u00a0min (including time for adjustment and participant instructions). In addition, it has a low financial investment for preparation and maintenance. The equipment enables the collection of essential data parameters needed for the evaluation of motor performance, such as average speed, average acceleration, duration time, and movement effectiveness \\[[@CR8], [@CR16], [@CR17]\\].\n\nThe analysis of temporal variables is usually restricted to the laboratory environment. They cannot be observed by conventional clinical instruments, but can only be verified by kinematic analysis equipment. These occur because they require controlled and customized environments, and because they have complex and expensive use, for this reason not being used in the clinical environment \\[[@CR10], [@CR18]\\].\n\nThus, these temporal measures are important at the clinical environment since they can be used in the therapeutic follow-up and the study of new therapeutic approaches, since these kinematic variables are not observed directly by clinical instruments and, usually, they are altered after stroke. The coordination of reach and grasp movements is complex \\[[@CR11]\\] and these individuals have difficulties in planning and controlling specific aspects of their movements, such as the speed and acceleration, which hinders harmonious motor performance and relearning movements \\[[@CR19]--[@CR21]\\].\n\nAdjusting speed control during a motor action is essential for performing quality motor skills movements \\[[@CR17]\\]. This variable, when evaluated, allows the verification of the movement performance during repetitions and reveals aspects of the performance improvement \\[[@CR16]\\]. Studies indicate that decreasing speed indicates worsening motor performance \\[[@CR1], [@CR22]--[@CR24]\\].\n\nAcceleration presents few reports of changes after post-stroke therapeutic interventions despite being an important aspect analyzed in kinematic evaluations \\[[@CR21], [@CR25], [@CR26]\\]. This measure reflects the smoothness of motor activity and implies faster movement onset and greater motor control throughout the action \\[[@CR11], [@CR27]--[@CR29]\\].\n\nRegarding the duration of movement, this parameter is considered an aspect of temporal efficiency \\[[@CR16]\\]. It can be defined as the time to perform a particular motor activity, starting from the initial stimulus interval until the completion of the task \\[[@CR30]\\]. Moreover, this measure also reveals data related to the motor performance of the evaluated individual where a decrease in the time to complete the activity indicates an improvement in the movement performance \\[[@CR16]\\].\n\nThe equipment enables the calculation of not only the total time to complete the task but also the time to reach each of the targets. This feature allows the observation of the variation of the interval between the targets. Since this variation is another indicator of execution time, it reveals which movements demand shorter or longer times to be performed by the participant.\n\nAnother variable that can be observed by the equipment is effectiveness, a measure that indicates the individual's ability to produce the motor result successfully. The evaluation of this parameter allows following the performance evolution along with the repetitions, besides allowing observation of the necessary adaptation or evolution of the chosen motor task \\[[@CR31]\\].\n\nIn this study, the sample obtained 100% effectiveness on both tasks (T1 and T2). This response is believed to have occurred because of the inclusion criteria adopted (to be able to perform the flexor and extensor synergies according to the FMA-UE), which selected patients with mild and moderate impairment.\n\nThe evaluation of these temporal parameters allows to visualize subtle differences, as can be observed in this study. All individuals evaluated were in the chronic phase of the disease and had high functioning, approaching the maximum score of conventional clinical instruments. These results may be overlooked or difficult to discover due to the ceiling effects of functional assessment tools \\[[@CR15]\\]. However, from the TDAI evaluation, it was possible to compare the performance of the paretic limb with the non-paretic limb and to verify that there was still a capacity to be explored in all individuals who participated in this study, enabling a comprehensive and detailed assessment of motor changes in the UE even with those with mild impairment.\n\nIn addition, within the stroke group, people with moderate impairment had more marked kinematic deviation controls compared to people with mild impairment \\[[@CR11]\\]. Therefore, individuals with higher levels of motor impairment would present more statistically significant variables when comparing the motor performance of the paretic limb with the non-paretic limb.\n\nWe believe that the TDAI can be used not only in comparative aspect (pre-/post-treatment) of reach and grasp, but also in the training of these movements. In addition, it can be also used as a parameter for the adaptation or progression of the exercises, since our equipment analyzes not only efficiency, but also effectiveness variables. It is still possible to increase the capacity of the TDAI analysis using it in conjunction with other devices, such as surface electromyography (sEMG) and/or accelerometer, besides generating the equipment parameters, co-contraction measures (agonist and antagonist muscles), reaction times, and peak speeds, for example.\n\nIn this study, we also related the results of TDAI with the conventional clinical tests, but few correlations were observed. We credit this to the fact that the evaluated aspects of human movement are different from those measured, since conventional clinical instruments have results on ordinal scales (REACH and ARAT) or number of cubes transported (BBT), while the device has numerical results corresponding to temporal variables \\[[@CR27], [@CR32], [@CR33]\\].\n\nAs these assessments observe different aspects, thus bringing different analyzes of the individual's condition and motor capacity, we suggest the use of TDAI as a complement to conventional clinical instruments, promoting a standardized and more detailed and less subjective results regarding the motor performance evaluation of reach and grasp movements post-stroke.\n\nLimitations and future research {#Sec4}\n===============================\n\nConsidering the use of the equipment compared with the instruments of kinematic analysis, the present study does not provide an analysis of all aspects addressed in kinematic programs and is therefore not as detailed. However, the device can be used in conjunction with other equipment, such as an EMG, to obtain other motor performance variables. Further research using equipment such as a reach and hold training strategy is suggested, as well as its application together with an EMG for UE motor performance assessment.\n\nConclusion {#Sec5}\n==========\n\nIn this study, we defined a set of parameters for the TDAI assessment of UE motor performance after stroke. The equipment elaborated in this study captures and processes the temporal variables of the motor performance, which are not observed by the conventional clinical instruments and reveals details that allow to identify even minor differences, being able to use the UE as a reference. In addition, due to its low weight and easy assembly and adjustments, beyond that to a short application time, it allows temporal assessments to be carried out also in the clinical environment, where commonly just conventional clinical instruments are used, allowing more detailed analyzes not only with purposes for research as well as in the daily life of rehabilitation.\n\nThe TDAI fulfilled the expected objectives; can, therefore, be used as an option for the low assessment of post-stroke UE reach and grasp movements, easy and quick to apply, without the need for calibration; and is portable so the evaluator can have access to it at all times. Thus, monitoring these temporal variables in the clinical setting through TDAI enables the therapist to be able to plan, adjust, and progress a personalized treatment plan.\n\nMethods {#Sec6}\n=======\n\nThe Temporal Data Acquisition Instrument (TDAI) system was designed by the authors and provide an automated interface with data acquisition, capture, and processing data of temporal human movement variables (movement times, mean velocity, mean acceleration, and movement effectiveness) from the upper limb extremity (UE) using two motor skills (reach--point: T1 and reach--grasp--fit: T2). The TDAI system was built to be used easily by the therapist in a clinical setting, has a low cost of installation and maintenance (was designed and built with investment less than \\$25), and is capable of producing temporal kinematic information on reaching, grasping, and pointing movements.\n\nEquipment design {#Sec7}\n----------------\n\nThe TDAI allows the assessment of reach--grasp and pointing movements by two tasks. In T1 (reach-point), the participant must reach and touch three targets arranged in an \"L\" shape. While in T2 (reach--grasp--fit), the individual must carry a glass between two distinct targets spaced 15\u00a0cm apart.\n\nThe material is composed of a single board, rectangular (28.19\u00a0cm in length, 20.35\u00a0cm in width, and 5\u00a0mm in depth). At the anterior part, the targets that must be reached in each activity are indicated: three targets arranged in an \"L\" shape (T1) and two distinct circumferences of 5\u00a0cm in diameter (T2).\n\nThe back part of the board is used for positioning capacitive sensors by snapping them into hollow parts (rectangles measuring 14.7\u00a0mm\u2009\u00d7\u200911\u00a0mm\u2009\u00d7\u20094\u00a0mm), in reference to targets positioned on the front of the plate (see Fig.\u00a0[1](#Fig1){ref-type=\"fig\"}). However, as the entire back part of the board is made up of hollow rectangles, it is possible that the capacitive sensors are positioned not only according to the tasks determined by the authors, but also to use the arrangement that is desired.Fig.\u00a01Front and back of the board. TDAI consists of a single plate, that can be positioned vertically (T1) or horizontally (T2). On the front of the board (**a**) the targets of each activity are indicated (targets represented by \"x\"---T1; items \"A\" and \"B\"---T2). The back of the board (**b**) is intended for fitting the capacitive sensors, referring to the selected targets on the front of the board. Targets related to task 1 were represented by numbers to indicate the sequence to be followed, as well as by rectangles of different colors (**c**). The targets of task 2 consisted of two circles, where the cup was to be transported from the farthest target and fitted to the nearest target (**d**)\n\nThe TDAI has two structures that allow its positioning on the table according to the activity. It can remain vertically (T1) or be placed horizontally (T2). The main board and its accessories (cylinders and bracket) were constructed of poly-plastic (PL) filaments.\n\nThe equipment contains a circuit referring to capacitive sensors, components used for the acquisition of time data. They are inserted into the rectangular cavities, positioned according to the activity to be performed. The capacitive touch sensor (11\u00a0mm width\u2009\u00d7\u200914.5\u00a0mm length\u2009\u00d7\u20092.3\u00a0mm height) was used to replace the direct button switch to ensure user accessibility.\n\nSensor input voltages range from 2 to 5.5\u00a0V DC. The Touch TTP-223 module has a maximum response time of 60\u00a0ms after incitation. This component is responsible for identifying the individual's touch and sending the electrical impulses from the incitement to the ATmega328 microcontroller that processes the information with a 16-MHz clock, which ensures system reliability (see Fig.\u00a0[2](#Fig2){ref-type=\"fig\"}).Fig.\u00a02Signal conditioning circuit of the sensor. Sensor input voltages range from 2 to 5.5\u00a0V DC. The touch module TTP-223 processes the information with a 16-MHz clock, being sensitized\u2009\u2264\u200960 ms after contact. The 22-pF capacitor adjusts sensor sensitivity; 100-nF and 100-uF capacitors stabilize input voltages, eliminating high- and low-frequency noise. Communication with the computer is UART, using the I2C protocol\n\nEvaluation by the TDAI system {#Sec8}\n-----------------------------\n\nThe assessment using the TDAI consists of a single session protocol, lasting 20--30\u00a0min, where two reaching and grasping activities are performed with the affected UE. The clinical protocol was performed with the patient sitting, with the back-supported and trunk-free (without restrictions), facing a table with adjustable height, and the elbow positioned at 90\u00b0 of flexion, the shoulder at 0\u00b0 and the hand on the table at a demarcated point (Fig.\u00a0[3](#Fig3){ref-type=\"fig\"}).Fig.\u00a03Participant positioning for TDAI assessment. To perform both tasks the individual is positioned in the same way, and the adjustments are made only on the platform, where for task 1 it is placed vertically (left image), while for task 2 the platform remains horizontal (right image)\n\nBefore the start of each task, simple verbal instructions and a demonstration were passed to the evaluated patients. Sixteen repetitions of each task were performed for each upper limb, with an interval of 15\u00a0s between each repetition and 3\u00a0min between each type of task. Each repetition was preceded by a sound trigger (from data acquisition plate), issued by the evaluator, as a reference to the participant to start the movement with his usual velocity.\n\nFor T1 (reach--point), the equipment is vertically fitted to the table, away from the margin equivalent to 90% of arm's length---the distance measured between the axillary line and the styloid process of the radius from the sternum. Capacitive sensors are positioned so that the targets are in the shape of the letter \"L,\" where the distance between the first and second target is 15\u00a0cm (from its center) and 8\u00a0cm between the second and third targets.\n\nFor the accomplishment of T2 (reach--grasp--fit), the subject remains in the same position. However, modifications are made to the equipment: the capacitive sensors are repositioned so that they are straight and spaced at 15\u00a0cm. The main board is fitted to the table horizontally, and two cylinders (6\u00a0cm in diameter) are fitted into the front of the plate, in the same direction as the sensors, forming two different targets---where the farthest remains at 90% of arm's length from the table edge. After the firing sound, the subject should reach for a glass (5\u00a0cm in diameter, 8\u00a0cm high), fitted to the farthest target, hold it, carry it, and fit it to the nearest target. At the end of each repetition, the patient returns to the starting point, and the instructor returns the cup to target 1.\n\nClinical outcome measures {#Sec9}\n-------------------------\n\nThe TDAI processes information about the time to reach each target (s), total activity time (s), mean speed (cm/s), mean acceleration (cm/s^2^), and effectiveness (number of hits). These functions are performed on a practical, fast, economical, and manageable piece of equipment that does not require calibration or maintenance.\n\nThe variables are found using simple equations and by performing the routine to obtain the data in the spreadsheet software. The values for movement time are divided into the total time and times to reach targets 1, 2, and 3 (T1) and times to reach targets 1 and 2 (T2).$$\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n                \\usepackage{amsmath}\n                \\usepackage{wasysym} \n                \\usepackage{amsfonts} \n                \\usepackage{amssymb} \n                \\usepackage{amsbsy}\n                \\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n                \\usepackage{upgreek}\n                \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n                \\begin{document}$$\\Delta t = t - t_{o}$$\\end{document}$$\n\nIn Eq.\u00a0[1](#Equ1){ref-type=\"\"}, \u2206*t* is the time value to be found, where *t*~o~ refers to the time of the beep and *t* the time the target has been reached.

Efficacy values are obtained as a percentage, where 100% is 16 hits (all repetitions).\n\nExperimental protocol {#Sec10}\n---------------------\n\nThe experimental protocol was carried out at Trairi Health Sciences Faculty (Facisa-UFRN), located in Santa Cruz-Rio Grande do Norte--Brazil. Eight patients with a clinical diagnosis of stroke, who were capable of performing flexor/extensor synergy movements related to the Fugl Meyer Assessment for Upper Limb Extremity (FMA-UE) with a score between 1 and 2, had an absence of sensory alteration in UE evaluated by the Nottingham Scale, or the presence of cognitive impairment assessed by the Mini-Mental Status Examination---MMSE (cutoff 20 points for illiterate; 25 to 28 for schooled \\[[@CR34]\\]). All patients experienced a single unilateral stroke and should be over 18-year old.\n\nA prior clinical evaluation (FMA-UE, Nottingham Scale, and MMSE) was performed to characterize the sample and inspect the inclusion and exclusion criteria and lasted 40\u00a0min. Subsequently, a trained therapist used specific clinical instruments (REACH Performance Scale, BBT, and ARAT) intended for the analysis of reach and grip movements (30\u00a0min for testing). The Reach Scale (REACH) focuses on compensatory strategies that are used during the transport phase in the range of motion and is defined by the beginning of the movement until the object is reached.\n\nThe test is divided into two sub-items, which are the near target (1\u00a0cm from the table's edge) and distant target (30\u00a0cm from the table's edge) \\[[@CR35]\\]. Each subcategory evaluates six components: trunk dislocation, movement fluidity, shoulder movements, elbow movements, and grip. Each component ranges from 0 to 3 (where 0 indicates maximum compensation and 3 is equivalent to normal movement), corresponding to a maximum score of 18 points \\[[@CR35]\\].\n\nThe BBT consists of a manual dexterity test where a wooden box is used, divided in half in two parts by a partition higher than the edges of the box. Evaluation occurs by the number of wooden cubes (2.5\u00a0cm) carried from side to side of the box for 1\u00a0min. The test is performed primarily with the unaffected limb, followed by the compromised limb \\[[@CR36]\\].\n\nFinally, the ARAT, also known as the Upper Limb Extremity Action Test, has 19 items that evaluate complex grip-related UE activities. The score ranges from 0 (no movement can be performed) to 57 (indicating normal motor performance). This scale does not allow classifying subjects as normal, mild, or severely limited \\[[@CR37]\\].\n\nStatistical analysis {#Sec11}\n--------------------\n\nBioEstat version 5.3 was used for data analysis. The normality of the data was evaluated using the Shapiro--Wilk test, and non-parametric tests were applied. The study population and clinical characteristics were defined using descriptive statistics. The ability to discriminate changes resulting from stroke was verified with the Mann--Whitney test that was used to compare paretic and health limb motor performance. A Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (for this, an average of 16 repetitions of each task was performed) was performed to observe the correlation between the measurements obtained from the task variables in the TDAI system with the clinical instruments. The following correlation classification was used; no or very low: *p*\u2009=\u20090--0.25; low: *p*\u2009=\u20090.26--0.40; moderate: *p*\u2009=\u20090.41--0.69; high: *p*\u2009=\u20090.70--0.89; very high: *p*\u2009=\u20090.90--1.0 \\[[@CR38]\\].\n\nFMA\n\n:   Fugl Meyer Assessment\n\nBBT\n\n:   Box and Blocks Test\n\nARAT\n\n:   Action Research Arm Test\n\nT1\n\n:   Task 1\n\nT2\n\n:   Task 2\n\nUE\n\n:   Upper Limb Extremity\n\nMMSE\n\n:   Mini-Mental Status Examination\n\nTDAI\n\n:   Temporal Data Acquisition Instrument\n\nsEMG\n\n:   Surface electromyography\n\nUFRN\n\n:   Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte\n\n**Publisher\\'s Note**\n\nSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.\n\nThe authors would like to thank the Ph.D. electrical engineer professor Rodrigo Licio Ortolan and the Ph.D. physiotherapist professor Aline Braga Galvao Silveira Fernandes for helpful discussions about this study.

{"text": "Effect of competitive adsorption on zinc removal from aqueous solution and zinc smelting effluent by eucalyptus leaf-based magnetic biosorbent.\nThe objectives of this study were to investigate the competitive sorption behaviors and mechanisms of heavy metals onto ELMB, a novel eucalyptus-leaf-based magnetic biosorbent, and to study the potential application of ELMB in the treatment of actual zinc smelting effluent after a necessary pretreatment process. ELMB and ELMB-metals systems were characterized using several techniques. Competitive sorption of Zn2+ with Pb2+, Cu2+ and Cd2+ onto ELMB was studied by batch experiments and the used sorbent was separated under a magnetic field. The results show that the ELMB can be considered as paramagnetic material with various functional groups on its surface. The presence of Pb2+, Cu2+ and Cd2+ significantly decreases the sorption of Zn2+ in either the binary system or multimetal systems. The order of adsorption preference is Pb2+ > Cu2+ > Cd2+ > Zn2+ in multimetal systems and the sequence of competitive ability to zinc is: Pb2+ > Cu2+ > Cd2+. Non-competitive Langmuir multicomponent isotherm model fits to the adsorption data of Pb2+ and Cu2+ well in aqueous solution. The co-existent Ca2+ and SO42- decrease the removal efficiencies of heavy metals while the presence of Na+ and Cl- shows little effect in the multimetal solution. In the case of actual zinc smelting effluent, \"pretreatment + ELMB sorption\" is successfully applied to remove heavy metals and the contents of Zn2+ and its associated metals are well below discharge limits.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "PubMed Abstracts"}}

{"text": "Thioredoxin and peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase: convergence of similar structure and function in distinct structural folds.\nThioredoxin (Trx) and peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase (PMSR) are small thiol oxidoreductases implicated in antioxidant defense and redox regulation of cellular processes. Here we show that the structures of Trx and PMSR exhibit resemblance in their alphabeta core regions and that the active site cysteines in two proteins occupy equivalent positions downstream of a central beta-strand and at the N-terminus of an alpha-helix. Moreover, we identified a PMSR subfamily that contains an active site CxxC motif (two cysteines separated by two other amino acids) positioned similarly to the catalytic redox active CxxC motif in Trx. However, Trx and PMSR are characterized by distinct ancient folds that differ in both orientation of secondary structures and their patterns. Trx is a member of the Trx-fold superfamily, whereas PMSR has a unique fold not found in other proteins. The data suggest that similar structures and functions of Trx and PMSR were acquired independently during evolution and point to a general strategy of identifying new redox regulatory proteins.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "PubMed Abstracts"}}
{"text": "Laser balloon angioplasty: effect of exposure duration on shear strength of welded layers of postmortem human aorta.\nLaser Balloon Angioplasty (LBA) is a technique that may improve the results of balloon angioplasty by thermally sealing arterial dissections and reducing elastic recoil. To define the relationship between laser-exposure duration and the strength of thermal welds made between separated layers of arterial wall, 360 1-cm discs of human postmortem aorta were lased for six different exposure intervals at three different temperature ranges, comparing shear strength of thermal welds in the different groups. Twenty discs were lased to achieve plateau adventitial temperatures of 95 degrees C-104 degrees C (group A), 105 degrees C-114 degrees C (group B), or 115 degrees C-124 degrees C (group C) at each of the exposure periods (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 sec). A 400-micron fiberoptic coupled to a 1.06 micron continuous wave neodymium:YAG laser was placed perpendicularly 8 mm above the luminal surface of each disc, which had been split midway between the intimal and adventitial surface and reapposed. Mean laser energy ranged 78-378 J delivered in a decremental stepwise fashion to achieve quickly and maintain the target plateau tissue temperature. Mean weld strength increased in relation to both achieved tissue temperature and laser-exposure duration, with at least 10 sec necessary, at temperatures greater than 95 degrees C, for reliable thermal welding. Laser exposure for greater than 20 sec provided no statistical increment in weld strength. In the anticipated clinical performance of LBA, these data suggest that when thermal fusion of disrupted arterial tissues is desired, a laser-exposure duration of 10-20 sec is optimal.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "PubMed Abstracts"}}

\"It's a wonderful gathering, don't you think?\" \"Hmm.\" \"It's nice, bringing everyone together like this.\" \"This would make a perfect target, wouldn't it?\" \"Whole town together in one place.\" \"I just came from the hospital.\" \"Ted didn't make it.\" \"He's dead?\" \"Burned over 90% of his body.\" \"Maybe you should say a few words, Mr. Mayor.\" \"Lift their spirits.\" \"That's not a bad idea.\" \"Hey, folks.\" \"Could I have your attention, please?\" \"Come on.\" \"Move in here, move in here, move in here.\" \"Yeah, I just wanted to welcome you all to our wonderful fellowship gathering.\" \"So, relax, everyone.\" \"Have some fun.\" \"Hey, say hello to your neighbor.\" \" Excuse me.\" \" Because it's just another beautiful day in the friendliest place on Earth.\" \"Mayor, I'd like to say a word.\" \"Sheriff Burke, ladies and gentlemen.\" \"Listen, folks, this really isn't the best time for this.\" \"As many of you may have heard, last night, a bomb went off right here in the middle of Main Street, not far from where you people are standing.\" \"And several of the people connected to this crime have gone missing.\" \"So, until we get the situation sorted out,\" \"I think it's best if everybody goes home and stays safe.\" \"Let's wrap it up, please.\" \"All right, everyone.\" \"You heard Sheriff Burke.\" \"Let's go.\" \"Why didn't you tell me about this?\" \"I didn't want to interrupt your investigation.\" \"Nothing matters more than keeping the populace calm a-a-and quiet.\" \"I'm afraid the ship's already sailed.\" \"Hey.\" \"Hey.\" \"How are you?\" \"You know, I had a concussion when I was your age, playing football.\" \"I got hit running a quick slant across the middle.\" \"I don't remember too much of what happened after that.\" \"My ears were ringing for a couple of days.\" \"So, I guess it hasn't been all that much fun, huh?\" \"Hey.\" \"Hi.\" \"No, I guess not.\" \"Especially considering that it all could have been avoided.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"You had the guy, Dad.\" \"You had him and you let him go.\" \"Ben, what are you talking about?\" \"Your dad, he saved your life.\" \"No, no, that's okay.\" \"I heard that you arrested the guy who made the bomb and then you let him go.\" \"Well, there's a reason for that.\" \"Sometimes we let a suspect walk to see where it will lead us.\" \"It just kind of makes me wonder if you would have...\" \"I don't know.\" \"If you would have made the same decision if he wasn't married to Kate Hewson.\" \"Ben, that's a terrible thing to say.\" \"He can say whatever he wants.\" \"You're supposed to enforce the laws of Wayward Pines.\" \"You're not supposed to be lenient with people because you know them.\" \"Hey.\" \"I would have done the same thing no matter who it was.\" \"Ben, is your teacher telling you to say all of this stuff?\" \" Is that what's happening right now?\" \" No, hey.\" \"Is it the teacher?\" \"Ben, it doesn't matter.\" \"Look.\" \"Ben, we love you.\" \"And we're just... we're just happy that you're okay.\" \"Get...\" \"get plenty of rest.\" \" Hey.\" \" Hey.\" \"Hi, Amy.\" \"Look who's here.\" \"We'll talk about this later.\" \"Hi.\" \"So, no one in Surveillance is breaking any rules or...\" \"or protocols.\" \"Well, if there's a problem, it must be a software glitch.\" \"Never had to punish anyone on the inside before.\" \"No.\" \"It'd be a terrible line to cross.\" \"And happily, we don't have to.\" \"No one is helping the insurgents.\" \"Oh, t-that's not what I asked.\" \"What I asked was, is anyone in Surveillance breaking any rules or protocols?\" \"No.\" \"Well... at least we have each other.\" \"Thank goodness for that.\" \"Did I ever tell you I want to be a nurse here when I grow up?\" \"No.\" \"That's cool, though.\" \"I can hear your heart.\" \"Yeah, well, I hope so.\" \"Buh-bum.\" \"Buh-bum.\" \"Buh-bum.\" \"Oh.\" \"It's getting faster now.\" \"Are you okay?\" \"Yeah, it's just a headache.\" \"I'm actually not supposed to be leaving my bed.\" \"Well, I'm glad you're okay.\" \"I'm glad you're okay.\" \"I never really thought about it before, but...\" \"last night made me realize how at any day, any point, we could just die.\" \"We didn't.\" \"We're alive.\" \"I think that teacher Megan's been whispering in his ear.\" \"I can just feel it.\" \"I can't stop thinking about what he just said, about how I had the guy and that I let him go.\" \"That's what happened with the Easter bombings.\" \"This now just in to the news room.\" \"We are getting live...\" \"Terrorist attacks in D.C. and Los Angeles at the

going on.\" \"I could never tell you.\" \"I was part of a joint terrorism task force.\" \"And we got word that Narwaz was down in Mexico.\" \"So we went down, we grabbed him, secured him, put him on a plane to transport him back to D.C.\" \"Then I got a call from headquarters.\" \"They told me to let him go.\" \"The guy's dirty.\" \"I knew he was dirty.\" \"\"Let him go.\"\" \"Well, that's exactly what I did.\" \"It was an order.\" \"And then three weeks later, 621 people are murdered... by Narwaz Al-Salaam.\" \"And I had the guy and I let him go.\" \"And it was classified.\" \"You know how bad

of your own, do you?\" \"Brad and I have not been so blessed.\" \"You do realize that Ben is our son and not yours.\" \"Theresa, we are on the same team.\" \"Are we?\" \"Because I'm starting to feel like every single thought that you put into Ben's head is somehow meant to undermine us.\" \"Let's just be honest here.\" \"You've got an agenda and I want to know what it is.\" \"You're starting to sound a little paranoid, Theresa.\" \"I simply believe that the children of Wayward Pines are the future of Wayward Pines.\" \"And to that end, I try to be as helpful as possible.\" \"Helpful right now would be for you to stay very far away from my family.\" \"Hey, Sheriff.\" \"So, what happened?\" \"Uh, I got here about an hour ago.\" \"Someone smashed one of our cameras, cut the lock, stole one of our trucks.\" \"What kind of truck was it?\" \"It's a 30-foot dump truck.\" \"What's going on, Sheriff?\" \"Is there gonna be another bomb?\" \"Maybe the truck is the bomb.\" \"What about the nightmares?\" \"Nothing.\" \"Last few years.\" \"Any explanation for that?\" \"Acceptance, I suppose.\" \"My life before, I was always running, searching, fighting.\" \"But the questions I had then

fear.\" \"There was terror everywhere.\" \"It's what my job as an agent was all about.\" \"And I won't lie.\" \"I fed on that adrenaline.\" \"But here, I don't know.\" \"It's as if I've been... forced to live one moment at a time.\" \"I'm still asking all the same questions, but the answers are less urgent now.\" \"Maybe because I feel safer.\" \"Have you and Harold, uh, thought any more about children?\" \"Mm, we have been talking about it, yes.\" \"You'd make a great mom, Kate.\" \"Hmm.\" \"Oh, can I get that refill?\" \"Oh.\" \"Uh, yeah.\" \"Thank you, Dr. Jenkins.\" \"Thank you, Kate.\" \"Hmm.\" \"Dr. Jenkins.\" \"Why didn't you come and talk to me before all this?\" \"You know I couldn't do that.\" \"Besides, what would you have said?\" \"\"Forget the truth\"?\" \"Your friend Ted has died.\" \"Two of our youngest seriously injured in the hospital.\" \"Others are missing.\" \"That's the price of your truth.\" \"You know it's not like that.\" \"You didn't mean for anyone to die.\" \"How many more need to be sacrificed?\" \"I thought you were happy.\" \"I thought we made progress.\" \"I know you did.\" \"How can you be so cheerful with neighbors you're putting into lethal

pie.\" \"Don't want that blood sugar dropping.\" \"Security.\" \"Hey.\" \"Reggie Hudson's been deleting surveillance footage.\" \"But you know that already.\" \"Well, he... he did show some sympathy for the residents.\" \"Did he help the people who bombed the perimeter?\" \"No.\" \"No, David.\" \"Not at all.\" \" He had no idea they were...\" \" He's a traitor.\" \"He needs to be taken care of.\"

{"text": "1. Field of the Invention\nThe present invention relates to a semiconductor device and a method of fabricating the same and, more particularly, to a semiconductor device capable of increasing an effective channel length and width, which has a plurality of grooves and a method of fabricating the same.\n2. Description of the Related Art\nAs semiconductor memory devices are highly integrated, a width of a gate electrode of a MOS transistor is reduced to about 0.1 \u03bcm and a channel length of the MOS transistor must be reduced. With reduced channel length, electrons can easily pass a gate insulating layer of the MOS transistor, and the so called \u201chot carrier effect\u201d occurs because an electric field between a source and a drain of the MOS transistor is strengthen by the reduced channel length, causing flow of leakage current. Thus, the short channel effect from a reduced channel length of the MOS transistor adversely affects characteristics of the MOS transistor.\nOne way to alleviate the short channel effect is by elongating the channel length without changing a design rule of the gate electrode.\nFIGS. 1A to 1C are cross-sectional views of structures illustrating a conventional fabricating method of a semiconductor device having grooves for elongation of effective channel length.\nReferring to FIG. 1A, nitride layer patterns 12 are formed on a semiconductor substrate 10 having a device isolation layer (not shown) to expose a channel region of a MOS transistor. Next, insulating layer spacers 14 are formed on both lateral sides of the nitride layer patterns 12. Then, a thermal oxide layer 16 is formed on an exposed semiconductor substrate 10 by a thermal oxidation process.\nReferring to FIG. 1B, the thermal oxide layer 16 and the insulating spacers 14 are removed by a wet etching process to form a groove 18. Next, ions 20 are implanted on the semiconductor substrate 10 adjacent to the groove 18 for controlling a threshold voltage. Next, a gate insulating layer 22 is deposited on the semiconductor substrate 10 having the groove 18 at a predetermined thickness, and a polysilicon layer 24 is deposited on the semiconductor substrate 10 having the gate insulating layer 22 to fully fill the groove 18 between the nitride layer patterns 12. The polysilicon layer 24 is planarized to form a gate electrode 24 by a chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process until the nitride layer pattern 12 is exposed.\nReferring to FIG. 1C, the nitride layer pattern 12 formed on both lateral sides of the gate electrode 24 is removed, and spacers 28 are formed on both lateral sides of the gate electrode 24. Conjunction regions 26 and 30 having a lightly doped drain (LDD) are formed beneath the spacers 28 and adjacent to the bottom of the spacers 28. As a result, a channel is formed under the gate electrode 24. The channel is formed to be elongated since the bottom surface of the gate electrode has a groove.\nHowever, as design rule of the gate electrode 24 is about 0.1 \u03bcm, the distance between the nitride patterns 12 should be within the design rule. During the thermal oxidation process for forming the thermal oxide layer 16, the semiconductor substrate 10 is subject to severe stress because of the nitride layer pattern 12, even if the spacers 14 are formed. Further, when the thermal oxidation process is partially performed, a bird's beak can be easily formed, thereby making difficult the forming of a delicate groove. Thus, there still continues to be a need for an improved fabricating method for elongating an effective channel length and width to improve current characteristics of a semiconductor device.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "USPTO Backgrounds"}}

Obes Sci Pract. 2019;5:521--530. 10.1002/osp4.366\n\n1. INTRODUCTION {#osp4366-sec-0005}\n===============\n\nAs a major public health crisis nationally and internationally, obesity rates continue to rise, exceeding[1](#osp4366-bib-0001){ref-type=\"ref\"} an estimated 38%. Obesity is known to adversely impact cardiometabolic factors, including hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia,[2](#osp4366-bib-0002){ref-type=\"ref\"} ultimately increasing vascular risk and leading to disability[3](#osp4366-bib-0003){ref-type=\"ref\"} and death.[4](#osp4366-bib-0004){ref-type=\"ref\"} The escalating costs associated with obesity in the United States demonstrate a critical need to address this epidemic[5](#osp4366-bib-0005){ref-type=\"ref\"} given that direct and indirect costs account for 9.3% of the gross domestic product.[6](#osp4366-bib-0006){ref-type=\"ref\"} Conditions are even worse in rural areas of the United States where obesity prevalence rates are much higher[7](#osp4366-bib-0007){ref-type=\"ref\"} and patients often need to travel extensive distances to access health care services and specialist providers.[8](#osp4366-bib-0008){ref-type=\"ref\"}, [9](#osp4366-bib-0009){ref-type=\"ref\"}, [10](#osp4366-bib-0010){ref-type=\"ref\"}, [11](#osp4366-bib-0011){ref-type=\"ref\"} Disparities in accessing care are especially problematic in caring for patients with obesity, where regular interactions are needed to promote health behaviour change.[12](#osp4366-bib-0012){ref-type=\"ref\"}\n\nMobile health interventions hold promise in engaging adults with obesity in behavioural change. For instance, self\u2010monitoring using commercial applications has demonstrated an increased likelihood of short\u2010term weight loss.[13](#osp4366-bib-0013){ref-type=\"ref\"}, [14](#osp4366-bib-0014){ref-type=\"ref\"} Goal setting through text messaging,[15](#osp4366-bib-0015){ref-type=\"ref\"} automated voice response systems,[16](#osp4366-bib-0016){ref-type=\"ref\"} or tailored self\u2010monitoring platforms[17](#osp4366-bib-0017){ref-type=\"ref\"} can all enhance success and are cost\u2010effective strategies to at\u2010risk populations. However, engagement drops off after initial usage suggesting a need for more personalized approaches.[18](#osp4366-bib-0018){ref-type=\"ref\"} In fact, at 12 months, there are no differences in weight loss between digital and control arms.[19](#osp4366-bib-0019){ref-type=\"ref\"} Recent studies using just\u2010in\u2010time adaptive interventions also hold considerable promise in influencing patterns of behaviour for engaging and sustaining weight loss.[20](#osp4366-bib-0020){ref-type=\"ref\"}\n\nThe emergence of telemedicine, two\u2010way live video\u2010conferencing, has been embraced by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services[21](#osp4366-bib-0021){ref-type=\"ref\"} as a different type of mobile health modality that can potentially surmount geographic barriers to health care delivery. With the advent of policy changes promoting rural broadband and cellular access,[22](#osp4366-bib-0022){ref-type=\"ref\"} telemedicine is increasingly available to both health care entities and patients alike. In rural obesity management, telemedicine is particularly promising because it reduces demands on patients\\' time by reducing the need to travel long distances and spend hours away from work[23](#osp4366-bib-0023){ref-type=\"ref\"} in order to attend high\u2010intensity visits recommended by the 2013 guidelines.[12](#osp4366-bib-0012){ref-type=\"ref\"} While an initial investment is needed, the payoff is significant in that it may reduce costs.[24](#osp4366-bib-0024){ref-type=\"ref\"} The affordability can allow rural patients increased access to specialists, making it a plausible method to deliver care.\n\nFew trials have evaluated the use of telemedicine in obesity management. The Veterans Affairs MOVE! trial has implemented telemedicine in effective and sustainable approaches.[25](#osp4366-bib-0025){ref-type=\"ref\"}, [26](#osp4366-bib-0026){ref-type=\"ref\"} Their programme, although, focused only on veterans with obesity across the United States and was not specific to rural areas. The delivery was based on using a telehealth monitor delivering electronic modules, rather than using a clinical care provider. Other studies focus on paediatric populations with hybrid models (in\u2010person and remote),[27](#osp4366-bib-0027){ref-type=\"ref\"}, [28](#osp4366-bib-0028){ref-type=\"ref\"}, [29](#osp4366-bib-0029){ref-type=\"ref\"}, [30](#osp4366-bib-0030){ref-type=\"ref\"} or the potential efficacy of low\u2010intensity models.[31](#osp4366-bib-0031){ref-type=\"ref\"}, [32](#osp4366-bib-0032){ref-type=\"ref\"} Studies have demonstrated mixed results in other populations, including pregnancy[33](#osp4366-bib-0033){ref-type=\"ref\"} or endometrial cancer survivors.[34](#osp4366-bib-0034){ref-type=\"ref\"} While diet\u2010quality and obesity are strongly associated with rural health care resource use,[35](#osp4366-bib-0035){ref-type=\"ref\"} there is a lack of pragmatic research strategies for delivering high\u2010intensity obesity therapy in rural areas. Our hypothesis in this pilot study was that an adaptation of an in\u2010person, 16\u2010week intensive lifestyle intervention could feasibly be delivered using telemedicine and would be acceptable and potentially effective for participants.\n\n2.

Study design and setting {#osp4366-sec-0007}\n-----------------------------\n\nThis was a single\u2010arm, non\u2010randomized study by enrolling participants attending the Dartmouth\u2010Hitchcock (D\u2010H) Weight and Wellness Center between November 2017 and September 2018. D\u2010H is a 396\u2010bed hospital serving over 1.5 million persons in the region and situated in Lebanon, NH, on the New Hampshire and Vermont border in Grafton County, which is classified as rural according to the 2010 census.[36](#osp4366-bib-0036){ref-type=\"ref\"} Sixty five percent of persons live in a health professional shortage area or medically underserved area. The centre was initiated in 2016 and, at that time, evaluated 385 new consultations for adult obesity management yearly. At the time of the study, staffing consisted of three physicians, an advanced practice registered nurse, a behavioural psychologist, a registered nurse exercise specialist, two health coaches, two registered dietitians, and administrative staff. Outcomes were assessed at an in\u2010person baseline and 16\u2010week visit. The study was approved by the Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects at Dartmouth College and NCT03309787.\n\n2.2. Intervention description {#osp4366-sec-0008}\n-----------------------------\n\nThe Healthy Lifestyle Program consisted of a 16\u2010week programme delivered by a health coach, registered dietitian, and nurse exercise specialist (see Table\u00a0[1](#osp4366-tbl-0001){ref-type=\"table\"}) focused on health\u2010behaviour change and based on the Diabetes Prevention Program.[37](#osp4366-bib-0037){ref-type=\"ref\"} Medication management and bariatric surgery are separate programmes within the clinic. Participants are referred from their primary care physicians and complete an initial comprehensive multidisciplinary intake prior to entering the lifestyle programme. As part of the lifestyle programme, patients have the option of choosing in\u2010person individual or group (up to 15\u201020) formats for weekly coaching visits. For the pilot, participants evaluated in the clinic were offered the opportunity to complete 30\u2010minute individual 1:1 coaching visits remotely via video\u2010conferencing (see below) after the initial evaluation, in lieu of in\u2010person care. Other participants were eligible for bariatric surgery or medication management and did not enter this programme. The structure and operational infrastructure paralleled that observed within on\u2010site care. In addition, participants were provided with a wearable fitness device during the study to enable them to track their physical activity as part of a separate research study.\n\n###### \n\nComponents of the Healthy Lifestyle Program at the Dartmouth Weight and Wellness Center\n\n  Staff                  Week                                                     Content\n  ---------------------- -------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------\n  Health coach           Week 1^a^                                                Mindfulness, goal setting\n  Week 2                 Hunger awareness, mindful eating                         \n  Week 3                 Working with emotions                                    \n  Exercise trainer       Week 4                                                   Movement vs exercise\n  Health coach           Week 5                                                   Managing thoughts\n  Week 6                 Stress + social support                                  \n  Week 7                 Problem solving                                          \n  Exercise trainer       Week 8                                                   Myths and truths\n  Registered dietitian   Week 9                                                   Detoxing your diet and food tracking\n  Week 10                Food label reading and serving size                      \n  Week 11                Meal planning, grocery shopping, preparing for success   \n  Exercise trainer       Week 12                                                  Sorting through the noise\n  Registered dietitian   Week 13                                                  The power of protein\n  Week 14                Healthy carbohydrates                                    \n  Week 15                Good/bad fats, review of the toolbox                     \n  Exercise trainer       Week 16                                                  Moving forward\n\nWeek 1 occurs after the initial visit at the center.\n\n2.3. Telemedicine delivery {#osp4366-sec-0009}\n--------------------------\n\nThe D\u2010H Center for Telehealth has an extensive infrastructure to support clinical initiatives within D\u2010H and provided logistical and technical support for this project. All study staff (health coaches, nurse, registered dietitians) were participated in multiple, on\u2010site training sessions to ensure familiarity with the telehealth platform. Live, mock sessions and ongoing on\u2010site support was provided by the research assistant (RA) and by a technology consultant from the Center for Telehealth. All communications were conducted through an HIPAA\u2010compliant *Vidyo* software platform that includes end\u2010to\u2010end data encryption using HTTPS (browsing), TLS (signalling), and AES encryption. Coaching sessions were conducted in a private clinical space, using a T450s Lenovo laptop and Logitech H390 USB Headset with a noise\u2010cancelling microphone. Participants were provided with a Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.1 tablet that was encrypted per institutional policies to conduct the intervention off\u2010site (ie, home) with the same software allowing them to interact with the study personnel.\n\n2.4. Recruitment and enrolment {#osp4366-sec-0010}\n------------------------------\n\nClinic schedules were initially reviewed by the RA. New patients were approached by the clinician and introduced the study opportunity to assess interest. The RA then further described the study, obtained consent, and scheduled a 1\u2010hour individual orientation for all subjects. Inclusion criteria consisted of English\u2010speaking, community\u2010dwelling adults, aged 18 to 65 years with a body mass index (BMI) \u2265 30 kg/m^2^ and otherwise willing to participate in the Healthy Lifestyle Program if recommended by the clinical provider. An additional requirement was access to high\u2010speed internet access with Wi\u2010Fi. All patients required an electronic medical record patient portal account; if one was not available, the RA assisted in its creation. Participants were excluded if they were unwilling to participate, as well as those with a medical record diagnosis of dementia, life\u2010threatening illness, psychiatric illness (untreated serious mental illness, suicidal ideation) precluding their participation in the study, or a history of bariatric surgery. All participants required medical clearance from their primary care provider and needed to provide voluntary written consent. The lead author (JAB) was responsible for training the RA during this process. All participants received a \\$20 incentive at each in\u2010person outcome assessment.\n\n2.5. Outcomes {#osp4366-sec-0011}\n-------------\n\nBaseline measures were chosen a priori based on their validity, brevity, use in routine clinical care, and availability in the electronic medical record. The RA obtained baseline demographic information and co\u2010morbid health conditions from the EMR. On\u2010site assessments occurred at baseline and at 16 weeks, with additional surveys conducted at 4\u2010week intervals (data not shown). Monthly weights were acquired using an A&D Medical Bluetooth enabled scale and captured using the application. Surveys were sent electronically using REDCap, a secure, web\u2010based application designed to support research data capture.[38](#osp4366-bib-0038){ref-type=\"ref\"}\n\nHeight was measured using a wall\u2010mounted stadiometer (SECA 216, Hamburg, Germany), with the participant standing barefoot, against a wall, with their weight evenly distributed on both feet and heels together. Three height measurements were taken, and the average was used as the final value. Waist circumference was measured by a registered nurse using a tape measure placed around the abdomen, just above the iliac crest, snug, and not compressing the skin. The participant was asked to relax, and measurements were taken at end\u2010exhalation. A bioelectrical impedance analyser (SECA mBCA 514, Hamburg, Germany) was used to assess weight, body fat, muscle mass, and visceral fat. Participants were instructed to remove any outer clothing, jewelry, shoes and socks, or tights and stood on the metal electrodes on the base of the machine, facing forward. A 6\u2010minute walk test was conducted by a nurse according to standard protocols,[39](#osp4366-bib-0039){ref-type=\"ref\"} in a 100\u2010ft hallway; a clinically significant difference was defined as 50 m.[40](#osp4366-bib-0040){ref-type=\"ref\"}, [41](#osp4366-bib-0041){ref-type=\"ref\"} Last, a 30\u2010second sit\u2010to\u2010stand test[42](#osp4366-bib-0042){ref-type=\"ref\"} was conducted, administered using an armless chair placed against a wall. Participants were instructed to sit in the middle of the chair, with their backs straight and feet shoulder width apart, with their arms crossed at the wrists and held against their chest. The participant was encouraged to complete as many repetitions of being fully seated to standing within the 30 seconds. Participants also completed the Yip Telemedicine Scale[43](#osp4366-bib-0043){ref-type=\"ref\"} that has been validated in patients with diabetes at the 16\u2010week timepoint only; it is a 15\u2010item, 5\u2010point scale (maximum score 75) representing satisfaction with telemedicine delivered interventions. Additional acceptability questionnaires were asked at the conclusion of the study. An exit\u2010interview at the end of the study was conducted that ascertained the participant\\'s impressions of the overall programme and what they liked/disliked about the programme. These interviews were digitally audio\u2010recorded and transcribed by <http://www.rev.com>, a commercial transcription programme.\n\n2.6. Analysis {#osp4366-sec-0012}\n-------------\n\nAll data were aggregated into REDCap. Descriptive statistics (means, standard deviations, medians, proportions, and range) were computed to assess feasibility and acceptability. The analysis focused on completers of the programme. Change in weight, percent weight loss, and waist circumference were our primary preliminary effectiveness outcomes. Paired *t* tests assessed change between baseline and follow\u2010up. All qualitative interview data were inputted into *Dedoose* and analysed by two researchers using thematic data analysis[44](#osp4366-bib-0044){ref-type=\"ref\"}, [45](#osp4366-bib-0045){ref-type=\"ref\"}, [46](#osp4366-bib-0046){ref-type=\"ref\"} consisting of \"open coding\" of transcripts, a process of labelling text to identify concepts related to acceptability.[47](#osp4366-bib-0047){ref-type=\"ref\"} This process enhances rigor by allowing for different views.[48](#osp4366-bib-0048){ref-type=\"ref\"} Codes were determined both a priori and inductively derived. Text excerpts were aggregated by code to distill patterns and themes related to the intervention\\'s acceptability. The analysis was conducted using STATA v.15, Microsoft Excel 2017, and REDCap\\'s data output for simple quantitative data analyses. While a *P* value \\< .05 was considered statistically significant, this pilot study was intended to investigate feasibility and was not powered to detect a statistically significant difference in our outcomes.\n\n3. RESULTS {#osp4366-sec-0013}\n==========\n\n3.1. Feasibility of recruitment and retention {#osp4366-sec-0014}\n---------------------------------------------\n\nClinicians approached 62 participants seeking treatment at the centre (Figure\u00a0[1](#osp4366-fig-0001){ref-type=\"fig\"}) of which 58 were eligible (93.5%) based on screening demographics. There were 37 participants enrolled (63.8%) exceeding our target of 30 patients. Of the 21/58 that were eligible but declined participation, 11 (19.0%) were unable to participate due to timing/logistical reasons, and 10 were uninterested participate in a video\u2010delivered intervention (17.2%). A total of 27 participants of the 37 enrolled (75.7%) completed the study; a successful attrition rate was defined as less than 20%. The most common reason for study discontinuation was patient participant noncompliance despite attempted communications to reach them; the clinic\\'s policy is to shift patients to MD directed care if they missed three visits in the lifestyle programme. Only one participant voiced that their discontinuation was due to issues pertaining to the technology.\n\n![Consort diagram of all participants using telemedicine in a rural, academic, and obesity clinic](OSP4-5-521-g001){#osp4366-fig-0001}\n\n3.2. Intervention adherence {#osp4366-sec-0015}\n---------------------------\n\nAll participants completed all study measures at baseline and follow\u2010up points while enrolled, exceeding the a priori threshold of 80% considered as successful. The proportion of study participants completing greater than 75% of sessions was favourable among those enrolled (73%) and among those completing the study (100%). Approximately 93%, 96%, and 67% of participants attended greater than 75% of health coach, nurse, and dietitian sessions, respectively.\n\n3.3. Baseline characteristics {#osp4366-sec-0016}\n-----------------------------\n\nCohort characteristics, both enrolled and completers, are presented in Table\u00a0[2](#osp4366-tbl-0002){ref-type=\"table\"}. There were no significant differences between completers and noncompleters except for insurance status. Mean age among those completing the study was 46.9 \u00b1 11.6 (range 27\u201064 years), and the proportion of females was high (88.9%). All participants represented themselves as white and not Hispanic. Mean body mass index was 41.3 \u00b1 7.1 kg/m^2^ and mean waist circumference was 120.7 \u00b1 16.8 cm.\n\n###### \n\nBaseline characteristics of participants\n\n                             Overall             Completers          Noncompleters       *P* Value\n  -------------------------- ------------------- ------------------- ------------------- -----------\n  Age, years                 46.9 \u00b1 11.6         46.1 \u00b1 12.3         48.9 \u00b1 9.8          .52\n  Range, years               27\u201064               27\u201064               27\u201060               \n  Female sex (%)             32 (86.5)           24 (88.9)           8 (80.0)            .48\n  Race, n (%)                                                                            \n  White                      37 (100)            27 (100)            10 (100)            \n  Hispanic status            0 (0)               0 (0)               0 (0)               \n  Primary insurance, n (%)                                                               \n  Medicare                   4 (10.8)            2 (7.4)             2 (20.0)            .28\n  Medicaid                   6 (16.2)            2 (7.4)             4 (40.0)            .02\n  Private                    28 (75.7)           23 (85.2)           5 (50.0)            .03\n  Self\u2010Pay                   \u2010                   \u2010                   \u2010                   \n  Smoking status, n (%)                                                                  \n  Current                    1 (2.7)             1 (3.7)             \u2010                   \n  Former                     12 (32.4)           7 (25.9)            5 (50.0)            .17\n  Never                      24 (64.9)           19 (70.4)           5 (50.0)            .25\n  Weight, kg                 116.5 \u00b1 28.8        113.1 \u00b1 25.4        125.7 \u00b1 36.5        .24\n  BMI, kg/m^2^                                                                           \n  Range                      31.8\u201079.9           31.8\u201056.5           35.3\u201079.9           \n  Mean                       42.2 \u00b1 9.1          41.3 \u00b1 7.1          44.7 \u00b1 13.3         .32\n  Median                     38.8 (36.2, 47.2)   38.8 (36.0, 45.6)   39.5 (37.2, 47.0)   \n  Waist circumference, cm                                                                \n  Mean                       122.2 \u00b1 19.1        120.7 \u00b1 16.8        126.0 \u00b1 24.6        .46\n  Range                      99.1\u2010185.0          99.1\u2010161.0          102.1\u2010185.0         \n  Comorbidities, n (%)                                                                   \n  Anxiety                    10 (32.3)           8 (34.8)            2 (25.0)            .58\n  Cognitive impairment       \u2010                   \u2010                   \u2010                   \u2010\n  COPD                       \u2010                   \u2010                   \u2010                   \u2010\n  CAD                        \u2010                   \u2010                   \u2010                   \u2010\n  Depression                 18 (58.1)           13 (56.5)           5 (62.5)            .75\n  Diabetes                   7 (22.6)            6 (26.1)            1 (12.5)            .38\n  Fibromyalgia               2 (6.5)             1 (4.3)             1 (12.5)            .38\n  High cholesterol           2 (6.5)             2 (8.7)             \u2010                   \n  Hypertension               10 (32.3)           9 (39.1)            1 (12.5)            .13\n  Nonskin cancer             \u2010                   \u2010                   \u2010                   \n  NAFLD                      6 (19.4)            6 (26.1)            \u2010                   \n  Osteoarthritis             3 (9.7)             1 (4.3)             2 (25.0)            .06\n  Rheumatologic disease      3 (9.7)             3 (13.0)            \u2010                   \n  OSA                        12 (38.7)           7 (30.4)            5 (62.5)            .08\n  Stroke                     1 (3.2)             1 (4.3)             \u2010                   \n\n*Note*.

Specifically, the mean level of satisfaction with the overall intervention was 4.48 \u00b1 0.58 (median 5; range 3\u20105), and individuals reported that the programme helped them to achieve their goals (4.44 \u00b1 0.64, 5; range 3\u20105). Overall, 92.6% (n = 25/27) of completers would have recommended the intervention to their family/friends. Video\u2010conferencing was considered an acceptable modality in allowing individuals to achieve their goals (mean 4.30 \u00b1 0.95, median 5, range 1\u20105). The Yip Telemedicine questionnaire (Table\u00a0[S1](#osp4366-supitem-0001){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}), a marker of telemedicine satisfaction, also suggested that the delivery modality was favourable to participants (mean 67.6 \u00b1 6.95 range 53\u201075). The staff did not experience any software or technical issues. Of the 430 sessions, 15 (3.5%) were delayed and only three (0.7%) were cancelled due to technical issues that included bandwidth issues or that a tablet was not charged.\n\n![Select questions asked to participants on the acceptability of the intervention.

Qualitative inquiry on the programme\\'s acceptability {#osp4366-sec-0018}\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nMany themes emerged through our participant end\u2010of\u2010study interviews (Table\u00a0[3](#osp4366-tbl-0003){ref-type=\"table\"}). The importance of time\u2010savings was observed throughout many of the conversations. Participants were highly positive about video\u2010conferencing rather than commuting for an in\u2010person evaluation. This enhanced control of their time, reduced anxiety and hassles, notably in enabling, and allowed for health consultations to occur within the context of a demanding job. Another theme included the simplicity of the video\u2010conferencing technology. The information delivery was helpful to all participants, and the programme provided considerable resources to enhance nutritional and behavioural strategies. In contrast, a significant criticism was the lack of peer\u2010support by participants and that a programme wholly based on video\u2010conferencing felt depersonalizing.\n\n###### \n\nRepresentative quotes highlighting acceptability\n\n  Theme                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Representative Quotation\n  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Delivery remotely vs in\u2010person                                                                                                                                                                                                                              You can be in your pajamas if you want to and do it \\[telemedicine\\]\n  \\[I can\\] live my natural life, without little to no disruption                                                                                                                                                                                             \n  Time\u2010savings                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Time.

DISCUSSION {#osp4366-sec-0020}\n=============\n\nAn evidence\u2010based weight loss intervention delivered using telemedicine was feasible and acceptable to rural adults with obesity. Importantly, the intervention led not only to weight loss but also to significant changes in visceral fat as measured by bioelectrical impedance with maintenance in appendicular muscle mass and improvements in strength measures. These results suggest that a future intervention using this delivery modality within a clinical setting can potentially overcome many hurdles/barriers to delivering high\u2010quality, intensive obesity care in this rural population.\n\nMany previously published obesity interventions occur within primary care environments[49](#osp4366-bib-0049){ref-type=\"ref\"} or in research centres.[50](#osp4366-bib-0050){ref-type=\"ref\"} Interventions such as the diabetes prevention programme are effective,[51](#osp4366-bib-0051){ref-type=\"ref\"} but their reach and dissemination, particularly in rural areas, are limited.[52](#osp4366-bib-0052){ref-type=\"ref\"} The importance of novel delivery methods such as telemedicine is that it can overcome geographic and operational barriers that have previously impeded the delivery of evidence\u2010based interventions widely. Among other pragmatic obesity trials in the literature, the majority of obesity trials using telemedicine have focused on paediatric,[27](#osp4366-bib-0027){ref-type=\"ref\"}, [30](#osp4366-bib-0030){ref-type=\"ref\"}, [53](#osp4366-bib-0053){ref-type=\"ref\"}, [54](#osp4366-bib-0054){ref-type=\"ref\"} workplace,[55](#osp4366-bib-0055){ref-type=\"ref\"} or veterans affairs populations.[26](#osp4366-bib-0026){ref-type=\"ref\"}, [56](#osp4366-bib-0056){ref-type=\"ref\"} Others have used telemedicine in disparity populations for weight maintenance.[57](#osp4366-bib-0057){ref-type=\"ref\"} To our knowledge, this telemedicine\u2010delivered multicomponent intervention is the first delivered from a rural, tertiary care medical centre that provides specialty obesity care. Findings from this pilot project demonstrate that participants felt positively about video\u2010conferencing and that telemedicine could be effective and feasible in obesity management programmes in rural settings.\n\nWhile adherence to the intervention, as represented by attendance and completion of outcome assessments, was high, the programme suffers from similar engagement issues that plague other obesity programmes, both in research and clinical settings. The clinical programme was specifically designed so that the first 8 weeks are health\u2010coach intensive and the last 8 weeks are predominantly dietitian related. While weight loss was observed, only 19% lost more than 5% of their body weight. This success rate is partially attributed to many factors. First, most comprehensive weight loss interventions last a minimum of 6 months rather than 16 weeks and such weight loss is represented in this period of time; long\u2010term outcomes and maintenance are needed. Second, while behaviours are critical to long\u2010standing behavioural change, a caloric reduction is the key component to losing weight. The educational materials and tools related to nutrition were presented in the latter parts of the intervention; hence, the extent of weight loss that would have expected if this information was delivered earlier in the study period may not have been observed. Future studies could alter the order of the sessions. Third, it is unclear whether the telemedicine modality impacted weight loss and if a hybrid (in\u2010person and remote) model is needed to augment and enhance weight loss that take advantage of peer and group leader relationships for support. The attrition rate parallels those observed in other studies**.** The study population\\'s readiness to change, ascertained through qualitative inquiry, which is known to impact willingness to engage in health promotion programmes, may have also played a factor. Marginal improvements in appendicular skeletal muscle mass could also account for improvements in function. During weight loss efforts, not only fat is lost but also muscle[58](#osp4366-bib-0058){ref-type=\"ref\"}; it is also possible that the nurse\u2010led resistance exercise sessions may have had a positive impact on body composition. These results suggest that further testing of the dose\u2010dependence of exercise training during weight loss interventions is warranted for this middle\u2010aged adult population within a clinical setting.\n\nSuch pilot findings should be interpreted with caution as the design was not randomized. The staff was also limited in space and resources. The evaluated intervention lasted only 16 weeks rather than the recommended minimum of 6 months and 14 encounters for high\u2010intensity obesity interventions.[12](#osp4366-bib-0012){ref-type=\"ref\"} Strengths include the team\\'s ability to recruit within the centre, the completion of outcome assessments by participants, and the acceptability of telemedicine to rural adults. It is unknown whether telemedicine may be as acceptable to urban\u2010dwelling populations, other rural populations, or parts of the country with ready access to services in delivering obesity care. Such an at\u2010risk, rural population with obesity at risk for health disparities would not ordinarily have access to these services.\n\n5. CONCLUSION {#osp4366-sec-0021}\n=============\n\nA multicomponent, telemedicine\u2010based obesity lifestyle programme appears to be feasible and acceptable to patients and is thus a promising approach for weight and visceral fat loss in rural populations. A randomized controlled trial is needed to evaluate this modality for future implementation and effectiveness as part of their routine practice.\n\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST {#osp4366-sec-0023}\n====================\n\nThere are no conflicts of interest pertaining to this manuscript.\n\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS {#osp4366-sec-0024}\n====================\n\nJ.A.B., A.C.M., A.B.W., and D.G.D. analysed and interpreted the data.

Direct measurements from murine intestinal tissue samples demonstrate an anthrax lethal toxin-dependent increase in neutrophil elastase activity in vivo as well. These findings correlate with marked lethal toxin-induced intestinal ulceration and bleeding in neutrophil elastase(+/+) animals, but not in neutrophil elastase(-/-) animals. Moreover, neutrophil elastase(-/-) mice have a significant survival advantage over neutrophil elastase(+/+) animals following exposure to anthrax lethal toxin, thereby establishing a key role for neutrophil elastase in mediating the deleterious effects of anthrax lethal toxin.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "PubMed Abstracts"}}
